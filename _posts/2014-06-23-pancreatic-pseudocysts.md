## Definition
* Pancreatic pseudocyst is a collection of pancreatic secretions contained within a fibrous sac comprised of chronic inflammatory cells and fibroblasts in and adjacent to the pancreas contained by surrounding structures

## Atlanta Classification (1992)

| Time Frame | Acute Interstitial Edematous Pancreatitis (IEP) | Necrotizing Pancreatitis (NP) |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Early (&lt; 4 weeks) | **Acute Peripancreatic Fluid Collections (APFC)** | **Postnecrotic Peripancreatic Fluid Collections (PNPFC)** |
| Late (&gt; 4 weeks)  | **Pancreatic Pseudocysts**                        | **Walled-off Pancreatic Necrosis (WOPN)**                 |
    
## Pathophysiology
* Pancreatic duct disruption
  * Acute pancreatitis
    * Ductal inflammation
    * Increased ductal pressure
  * Chronic pancreatitis
    * Postinflammatory fibrosis
  * Pancreatic trauma
* Pancreatic exocrine fluid leaks and pools
* Inflammatory response with fibroblast-mediated extracellular matrix formation
* Development of fibrous capsule
  * Lacks epithelial lining (hence "pseudocyst")
* Ductal injury may
  * Heal on its own
  * Have a persistent fistula
  * Develop into a ductal stricture
  
## Presentation
* Persistent/worsening abdominal/back pain
* Bloating
* Early satiety
* Nausea/vomiting
* Failure to thrive
* Mechanical compression
  * Biliary obstruction
* Inflammatory reaction
  * Mesenteric venous thrombosis
  * Variceal bleeding/ascites
  * Errosion into surrounding structures
    * Enteric fistula
    * Pseudoaneurysm
  * Rupture
    * Pancreatic ascites
    * Pleuropancreatic fistula
* Asymptomatic

## Diagnosis
* Rule out Cystic Neoplasm
* CT Abdomen/Pelvis with Contrast
  * Uniform, rounded, fluid-filled mass
  * Thickened, hyperdense capsule
  * Pancreatic Pseudocyst
    * Lesser sac
    * Paracolic gutter
    * Base of mesentery
    * Anterior stomach
    * Deep in retroperitoneum
    * Hemorrhage
      * Hyperdense material within cyst
    * Air
      * Enteric fistula
    * Calcification
      * Underlying chronic pancreatitis
  * WOPN
    * Necrosis
    * Heterogeneity of cyst fluid
    * Solid matter and particulate debris
* MRCP with Secretin Stimulation
  * Differentiate from Cystic Neoplasm
  * Detect solid debris in WOPN
* ERCP
  * More used for therapy than diagnosis
* EUS
  * Differentiate from Cystic Neoplasm
  * Elucidate cyst morphology
  * Cyst relationship to pancreatic duct
  * Identify presence of pancreatitis in surrounding pancreatic parenchyma
  * **High amylase level**
    * Communication with pancreatic duct (previous or current)
  * **Hight CEA level**
    * Mucinous neoplasm
    
## Management of Pancreatic Pseudocysts
* Natural history is spontaneous resolution
* Historically intervention recommended for
  * &gt; 6 cm
  * &gt; 6 weeks
* Currently watchful waiting is appropriate
* Symptomatic pseudocysts warrant investigation
  * MRCP (or ERCP)
* Pseudocyst communicating with Main Pancreatic Duct (normal duct anatomy)
  * *ERCP-guided sphincterotomy*
  * *ERCP-guided Transpapillary stent placement*
  * Both cause preferential drainage of pseudocyst into duodenum
* Pseudocyst without commuincation with Main Pancreatic Duct (or failed ERCP)
  * **[Cystogastrostomy]({% post_url 2014-10-26-cystgastrostomy %})** (endoscopic, laparoscopic, or open)
    * Stomach or duodenum must be densely adherent to pseudocyst
    * Anterior gastrostomy/duodenostomy performed
    * Firm, bulging surface on posterior wall represents cyst
    * Posterior gastrostomy made with energy device (cautery)
    * Cyst wall biopsy performed to rule out Cystic Neoplasm
    * Cysto-enteric anastomosis oversewn to ensure hemostasis
  * **[Cystoduodenostomy]({% post_url 2014-10-26-cystoduodenostomy %})** (endoscopic, laparoscopic, or open)
  * **Roux-en-Y Cystoenterostomies**
    * Drainge of pseudocyst not well adherent to stomach into jejunal limb
* Pseudocyst with underlying duct pathology
  * Pathology visualized on MRCP/ERCP (stricture/obstruction)
  * Drainage alone may result in long-term failure with recurrence
  * Pancreatic duct pathology is in body or tail of pancreas
    * Distal pancreatectomy
