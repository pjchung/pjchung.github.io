## Definition
* Pancreatic pseudocyst is a collection of pancreatic secretions contained within a fibrous sac comprised of chronic inflammatory cells and fibroblasts in and adjacent to the pancreas contained by surrounding structures

## Atlanta Classification (1992)
* Acute Interstitial Edematous Pancreatitis (IEP)
  * Acute Peripancreatic Fluid Collections (APFC)
    * Early (< 4 weeks)
  * Pancreatic Pseudocysts
    * Late (> 4 weeks)
* Necrotizing Pancreatitis (NP)
  * Postnecrotic Peripancreatic Fluid Collections (PNPFC)
    * Early (< 4 weeks)
  * Walled-off Pancreatic Necrosis (WOPN)
    * Late (> 4 weeks)
    
## Pathophysiology
* Pancreatic duct disruption
  * Acute pancreatitis
    * Ductal inflammation
    * Increased ductal pressure
  * Chronic pancreatitis
    * Postinflammatory fibrosis
  * Pancreatic trauma
* Pancreatic exocrine fluid leaks and pools
* Inflammatory response with fibroblast-mediated extracellular matrix formation
* Development of fibrous capsule
  * Lacks epithelial lining (hence "pseudocyst")
* Ductal injury may
  * Heal on its own
  * Have a persistent fistula
  * Develop into a ductal stricture
  
## Presentation
* Persistent/worsening abdominal/back pain
* Bloating
* Early satiety
* Nausea/vomiting
* Failure to thrive
* Mechanical compression
  * Biliary obstruction
* Inflammatory reaction
  * Mesenteric venous thrombosis
  * Variceal bleeding/ascites
  * Errosion into surrounding structures
    * Enteric fistula
    * Pseudoaneurysm
  * Rupture
    * Pancreatic ascites
    * Pleuropancreatic fistula
* Asymptomatic
