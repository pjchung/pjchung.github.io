### Epidemiology

* First described by *Courvosisier* in 1890
* 3% of intestinal obstructions
* Average age is 70 years
* More common in older women
* Female > Male (3:1 to 5:1)

### Pathogenesis

* Requires a preceding biliary enteric fistula between gallbladder and intestine
  * Commonly duodenum adjacent to gallbladder
  * Also between gallbladder and stomach, colon, small bowel
* *Large stone* impacts gallbladder leading to inflammation, pressure necrosis, erosion into adjacent hollow viscus
* Coexisting fibrotic reaction
  * Common hepatic duct
  * Common bile duct obstructions (**Mirizzi\'s Syndrome**)
* After endoscopic sphincterotomy for CBD stones

### Variations

* **Bouveret\'s Syndrome**
  * Large gallstone eroding into stomach with obstruction of stone at pylorus or proximal duodenum
  * Present with gastric outlet syndrome
  
### Diagnosis

* Many cases of gallstone ileus thought to be just small bowel obstruction at time of diagnosis
* Often diagnosis made in operating room

#### Symptoms
* Present with classic symptoms of bowel obstruction
  * Abdominal pain
  * Nausea
  * Vomting
  * Obstipation
  * Constipation
* Sporadic crampy pain
  * Stone \"tumbling\" proximal to distal in small bowel causing intermittent obstruction

#### Laboratory Values
* **Laboratory evaluation is non-diagnostic**

#### Imaging
* Abdominal X-Ray
  * Pneumobilia on plain x-ray
    * Occurs in 50% of films
  * Radiopaque gallstone
    * Rare
  * **Rigler\'s Triad**
    * Distended loops of small bowel
    * Pneumobilia
    * Radiopaque stone in right lower quadrant
* CT Abdomen/Pelvis
  * Most sensitive

### Management

* Patients often present **dehydrated** and with **electrolyte abnormalities**
* Initial focus on resuscitation and electrolyte correction
* Patients present with
  1. Bowel obstruction
  1. Inflammatory biliary process
    * Chronic fistula
    * Active inflammatory phlegmon
    * Uncommon to have biliary sepsis
* **Priority is to relieve bowel obstruction by removing the obstructing gallstone**
* Most common point of obstruction is **Ileocecal Valve**
* **One-Stage Procedure**
  * Definitive biliary procedure that is concomitant to management of small bowel obstruction
  * Associated with higher morbidity and mortality versus enterolithotomy
  * **Most fistulas (up to 80%) close spontaneously**
* Cholecystectomy
  * Avoided in setting of hemodynamic instability
  * Liberal use of **Intraoperative Cholangiography**
    1. Many patients will have a common duct stone
    1. Delineates anatomy in distorted field
* Refer patients to specialized hepato-biliary center if surgeon has little experiences in difficult open cholecystectomy

#### Operative Procedure

* Conventional **Enterolithotomy**
  * Gallstone milked backwards
  * Proximal longitudinal enterotomy made
  * Gallstone removed
  * Enterotomy then closed transversely
* Gallstone that is too tightly impacted to be removed
  * Enterotomy made over the stone
  * Gallstone removed
  * Area of bowel resected
* Examine remainder of alimentary tract for additional stones
  * Found in up to 5% of cases
 
#### Repeat Episodes

* Repeat episodes are rare
* Occur in 5% of postoperative patients
  * Usually within 6 months of first presentation
* 80% resolve spontaneously
