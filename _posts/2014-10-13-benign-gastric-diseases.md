## Gastric and Duodenal Ulcers

* Non-operative management is the standard
* Must rule-out malignancy when suspicious
* Malignant disease tends to be located along Greater Curvature
* Operative treatment in the setting of failed medical management
* Gastric Ulcer symptoms worsen with food intake
* Duodenal Ulcer symptoms alleviate with food intake

#### Risk Factors

* *Helicobacter pylori* infection
  * Associated with 90 - 95% of Duodenal Ulcers
  * Associated with 70 - 90% of Gastric Ulcers
  * Causes Chronic Antral Gastritis &#8594; increased acid and Gastrin production and reduced mucosal resistance to acid
* NSAIDs
  * 8-fold increased risk of Duodenal Ulcer formation
  * 40-fold increased risk of Gastric Ulcer formation
  * Suppressed Prostaglandin formation
* Cigarette Smoking
* Increased Acid Production
  * Associated with Type II and III ulcers

#### Diagnosis

* Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)
  * Visualization of ulcers
  * Tissue biopsy to rule-out malignancy and diagnose *H. pylori* infections
* *H. pylori* Infection
  * **Urea Breath Test**
  * **Serologic Antibody Testing**
  * Rapid Urease Testing via **Cod Liver Oil (CLO) Test**
  * Direct **Histologic Examination**
* Fasting Serum Gastrin Levels
  * In setting of *H. pylori* negative and non-NSAID user with recurrent disease despite adequate medical therapy
  * To rule-out **Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome** (very rare)
  
#### Medical Therapy

* *H. pylori* Erradication
  * Triple Therapy for 10 - 14 days
  * Quadruple Therapy for 10 - 14 days
* NSAID Cessation
  * PPI in addition
* Smoking Cessation
* Follow-up Endoscopy
  * **3% of ulcers harbor malignancy**
  
#### Surgical Therapy

* Truncal Vagotomy with Antrectomy (Billroth I or II)
  * Lowest recurrence rate (1 - 2%)
  * Highest postoperative morbidity (15 - 30%)
  * High mortality rate (1 - 2%)
* Truncal Vagotomy with Drainage Procedure
* Highly Selective Vagotomy (HSV)
  * Highest recurrence rate (5 - 15%)
  * Lowest postoperative morbidity (5 - 8%)
  * Lowest mortality rate

#### Johnson Classification of Gastric Ulcers

![johnson-classification](/assets/2014-10-13-benign-gastric-diseases/johnson_classification.png)

* **Type I**
  * Most common (60%)
  * Not thought to be related to acid hypersecretion
  * Associated with *H. pylori* infection however full etiology is unclear
  * **Billroth I with Vagotomy** is procedure of choice
  * **Billroth II with Vagotomy** or **Roux-en-Y** may be necessary due to anatomy
* **Type II**
  * **2** ulcers: along Incisura and in Duodenum
  * **Billroth I with Vagotomy** is preferred
  * **Billroth II with Vagotomy** or **Roux-en-Y** may be necessary due to inability to mobilize Duodenum due to involvement by ulcer
* **Type III**
  * Prepyloric location
  * **Billroth I with Vagotomy** is preferred
  * **Billroth II with Vagotomy** or **Roux-en-Y** may be necessary due to inability to mobilize Duodenum due to involvement by ulcer
  * **Full-thickness Excision with Highly Selective Vagotomy** is an alternative
    * Not recommended unless surgeon has considerable experience
    * Higher rates of recurrence due to leaving behind Gastrin-secreting tissue
* **Type IV**
  * Proximally located along Lesser Curvature near Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ)
  * Not thought to be related to acid hypersecretion
  * Goal of resection to maximize length of healthy gastric tissue to enable gastroduodenostomy
    * **Pauchet Procedure**
    * **Csendes Procedure**
* **Type V**
  * Can affect any portion of the stomach
  * Thought to be related to **NSAID** use
  * Cessation of NSAID and medical therapy (PPI or H2 blocker)
  * Bleeding is the most common complication
  * **Endoscopy with Injection or Cautery** is first line treatment
  * **IR localization of bleeding vessels with Embolization** is second line treatment
  * Surgical approach is for refractory cases
    * **Anterior Gastrostomy** to insepct mucosa with **Oversewing** of major bleeding sites
    * **Total Gastrectomy** can be life-saving

#### Giant Ulcers
* &gt; 3 cm in diameter
* 30% of Giant Ulcers harbor malignant disease
* Endoscopy with at least 12 biopsies of edge and base of ulcer (4 jumbo forceps, 8 regular forceps)

## Complications of Gastric and Duodenal Ulcers

#### Perforation

* Most common complication
* Subdiaphragmatic free air in 80 - 85% of XRs
* Aggressive fluid resuscitation
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics
* Prompt surgical repair
* **Duodenal Ulcers**
  * **Graham Patch** with postoperative *H. pylori* therapy
  * **Truncal Vagotomy with Drainage Procedure** in stable patient known to be *H. pylori* negative or who failed medical therapy
* **Gastric Ulcers**
  * **Wedge Resection with Oversewing** and specimen sent to pathology to exclude malignancy
  * **Graham Patch** with multiple **Biopsies** if ulcer is at a Juxtapyloric location that makes Wedge resection impossible

#### Hemorrhage

* Leading cause of mortality with PUD (5 - 10%)
* Spontaneous cessation of bleeding occurs in 70% of patients
* Aggressive fluid resuscitation
* Correction of coagulopathy
* **Endoscopic Therapy with Cautery or Epinephrine** indications
  * Hemodynamic instability
  * Continuous transfusion required
  * Hematemesis
  * BRBPR
  * Age &ge; 60 years
* Visible vessel or active bleeding confer greatest risk of rebleed &#8594; Endoscopic hemostasis
* **Surgical Therapy** indications
  * Continued hemodynamic instability
  * &gt; 6 units pRBC over 24 hours
  * &gt; 1 endoscopic interventions
  * **Duodenal Ulcers**
    * Gastroduodenostomy
    * Three-point oversewing of the Gastroduodenal Artery
    * Acid-reducing procedure in the hemodynamically stable patient
    * *H. pylori* erradication postoperatively to reduce recurrent bleed
  * **Gastric Ulcers**
    * **Biopsy** to rule out malignancy
    * **Wedge Resection or Oversewing** in the hemodynamically unstable patient
    * **Vagotomy and Antrectomy** can be considered in the hemodynamically stable patient

#### Obstruction

* Least common complication of Gastric Ulcers
* Can be due to acute inflammation and edema
* Nasogastric decompression with fluid and electrolyte replacement
* **Surgical Therapy** indicated if
  * Persistent obstruction after **7 days** of non-operative management
  * Recurrent obstruction
* Definite cure is resection and reconstruction
  * **Billroth I with Vagotomy** is the ideal
  * **Billroth II** or **Roux-en-Y** may be necessary if safe resection with tension-free anastomosis is not possible
* **Endoscopic Stenting with Dilatation** may be performed in patients that are poor surgical candidates

#### Vagotomies

* Goal is the Parasympathetic denervation of the acid-producing stomach tissue

![vagotomies](/assets/2014-10-13-benign-gastric-diseases/vagotomies.png)

* **Truncal Vagotomy**
  * Left Vagus Nerve &#8594; Anterior Trunk
  * Right Vagus Nerve &#8594; Posterior Trunk (tends to be approximately 1 cm from posterior stomach wall)
  * Divided at the level of the Distal Esophagus (approximately 4 cm from GEJ)
  * Requires mobilization of approximately 5 - 6 cm of esophagus for adequate exposure to identify the nerves
  * **Criminal Nerve of Grassi** is the first branch off the Posterior Trunk
    * Separation can be proximal to the Celiac Division of the Posterior Trunk
    * Failure to divide can result in recurrence (approximately 2/3 of ulcer recurrences are due to incomplete vagotomy)
  * Requires a concommitant **Drainage Procedure**

* **Selective Vagotomy**
  * Spares Posterior branches that innervate
    * Pancreas
    * Small Intestines
  * Spares Anterior branches that innervate
    * Liver
    * Gallbladder
  * Decreases morbidity associated with Vagotomy such as Diarrhea and Dumping
  * Used for **Refractory Duodenal Ulcers**
  * Requres a concommitant **Drainage procedure**
  
* **Highly Selective (Parietal Cell) Vagotomy**
  * Preserves **Nerves of Latarjet** that innervate and provide motor function to the Pylorus
  * Does **NOT** require a concommitant **Drainage procedure**
  
#### Drainage Procedures

![drainage-procedures](/assets/2014-10-13-benign-gastric-diseases/drainage_procedures.png)

* **Heineke-Mikulicz Pyloroplasty**
  * Longitudinal incision created through the Pylorus
  * Incision is closed in a transverse fashion
  
* **Finney Pyloroplasty**
  * *See diagram*

* **Jaboulay Gastroduodenostomy**
  * *See diagram*

#### Antrectomy

* Goal is to remove Antral glands containing G Cells
* Avoid **Total Gastrectomy** whenever possible
* Proximal Margin
  * Along the Antrum-Body physiologic junction when possible (Type I, II, III)
  * Removal of proximal ulcer while extending incision to leave more distal tissue as in **Pauchet Procedure** (Type IV)
  * **Subtotal Gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y** necessary for Gastric Ulcers within 2 cm of GEJ (Type IV)
* Distal Margin
  * Transection of healthy Duodenal tissue just distal to Pylorus
  * Posterior Duodenal Ulcer closely associated with Pancreas
    * Leave ulcer base while performing the Antrectomy as usual
    * With the source of inflammation removed the area heals without affecting the anastomosis

![billroth_i](/assets/2014-10-13-benign-gastric-diseases/billroth_i.png)

* **Billroth I (Gastroduodenostomy)**
  * Preferred reconstruction for most Benign Gastric Diseases
  * **Angle of Sorrow** &#8594; point where the reconstructed Lesser Curvature meets the Gastroduodenal suture line
    * Breakdown avoided by having healthy well-vascularized tissue and a tension-free anastomosis
    * **Kocher's maneuver** can be helpful to provide a tension-free anastomosis
  * Hand-swen anastomosis
  * End-to-end Anastomosis Stapler (EEA) placed through anterior gastrostomy

![billroth_ii](/assets/2014-10-13-benign-gastric-diseases/billroth_ii.png)

* **Billroth II (Gastrojejunostomy)**
  * Reserved for patients in whom tension-free Billroth I cannot be performed
  * **Reichel-Polya (Polya) Modification** &#8594; gastrojejunostomy incorporating entire length of gastric division
  * **Hofmeister-Finsterer (Finsterer) Modification** &#8594; gastrojejunostomy incorporating part of the gastric division
  * **Afferent Limb** should be **&lt; 20 cm**
    * Prevents **Afferent Limb Syndrome**
    * Mobilization of the Ligament of Treitz can be performed if necessary to provide a shorter limb
  * **Retrogastric** anastomosis facilitates drainage of the stomach
  * **Retrocolic** anastomoosis thought to prevent kinking of the **Afferent** and **Efferent** limbs
    * ![retrocolic_gastrojejunostomy_1](/assets/2014-10-13-benign-gastric-diseases/retrocolic_gastrojejunostomy_1.png)
    * ![retrocolic_gastrojejunostomy_2](/assets/2014-10-13-benign-gastric-diseases/retrocolic_gastrojejunostomy_2.png)
    * ![retrocolic_gastrojejunostomy_3](/assets/2014-10-13-benign-gastric-diseases/retrocolic_gastrojejunostomy_3.png)
    * ![retrocolic_gastrojejunostomy_4](/assets/2014-10-13-benign-gastric-diseases/retrocolic_gastrojejunostomy_4.png)
    * *Townsend and Evers Atlas of General Surgical Techniques, Chapter 32: Gastrojejunostomy*
  * Duodenal stump can potentially result in a **Stump Blowout**
    * 1 - 3%  postoperative leak rate
    * Usually occurs POD 6 - 10
    * Dissection of the Duodenal Stump away from the Pancreas for closure should be **AVOIDED**

![roux_en_y](/assets/2014-10-13-benign-gastric-diseases/roux_en_y.png)

* **Roux-en-Y Gastrojejunostomy**
  * Roux limb **&ge; 40 cm** helps prevent Bile Reflux
  * **Retrocolic** and **Antecolic** Roux limbs shown to have similar outcomes
  * Superior to Billroth II in terms of subjective symptoms and Bile Reflux
