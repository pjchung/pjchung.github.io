## Duodenal Ulcers

* Duodenal Ulcers symptoms
  * Sudden onset epigastric pain
  * Gnawing
  * Burning
  * Stabbing

## Gastric Ulcers

* Non-operative management is the standard
* Must rule-out malignancy when suspicious
* Malignant disease tends to be located along Greater Curvature
* Operative treatment in the setting of failed medical management
* Gastric Ulcer symptoms worsen with food intake
* Duodenal Ulcer symptoms alleviate with food intake

#### Risk Factors

* *Helicobacter pylori* infection
  * Associated with 90 - 95% of Duodenal Ulcers
  * Associated with 70 - 90% of Gastric Ulcers
  * Causes **Chronic Antral Gastritis** &#8594; increased acid and Gastrin production and reduced mucosal resistance to acid
  * Causes **Chronic Atrophic Gastritis** &#8594; gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia &#8594; **Gastric Cancer**
  * Associated with **Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) Lymphoma**
* NSAIDs
  * 8-fold increased risk of Duodenal Ulcer formation
  * 40-fold increased risk of Gastric Ulcer formation
  * Suppressed Prostaglandin formation
* Cigarette Smoking
* Increased Acid Production
  * Associated with Type II and III ulcers

#### Diagnosis

* Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)
  * Visualization of ulcers
  * Tissue biopsy to rule-out malignancy and diagnose *H. pylori* infections
  * Ulceration in distal Duodenum concerning for **Gastrinoma**
  * Duodenal ulcers appear as sharply demarcated, clean edges, with exposed submucosa
* *H. pylori* Infection
  * Invasive Tests
    * Direct **Histologic Examination**
    * Rapid Urease Testing via **Cod Liver Oil (CLO) Test** &#8594; performed on mucosal biopsy
    * Cultures &#8594; research purposes or resistant strains
  * Non-invasive Tests
    * **Urea Breath Test**
    * **Serologic Antibody Testing**
      * Cannot differentiate between active and previous infection
  
* Fasting Serum Gastrin Levels
  * In setting of *H. pylori* negative and non-NSAID user with recurrent disease despite adequate medical therapy
  * To rule-out **Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome** (very rare)
  
#### Medical Therapy

* *H. pylori* Erradication
  * Triple Therapy (BID for each agent) for 14 days
    * > PPI (Omeprazole 20 mg or Lansoprazole 30 mg) + Amoxicillin 1000 mg + Clarithromycin 500 mg
    * > PPI (Omeprazole 20 mg or Lansoprazole 30 mg) + Metronidazole 500 mg + Clarithromycin 500 mg
  * Quadruple Therapy for 14 days
    * > PPI (Omeprazole 20 mg Daily or Lansoprazole 30 mg Daily) + Metronidazole 500 mg TID + Tetracycline 500 mg QID + Bismuth subsalicylate 525 mg QID
* NSAID Cessation
  * PPI in addition
* Smoking Cessation
* Follow-up Endoscopy
  * **3% of ulcers harbor malignancy**
* 6 weeks medical therapy &#8594; EGD &#8594; 6 weeks medical therapy &#8594; EGD &#8594; Surgery if not healed

#### Surgical Therapy

* **Truncal Vagotomy with Antrectomy (Billroth I or II)**
  * Lowest recurrence rate (1 - 2%)
  * Highest postoperative morbidity (15 - 30%)
  * High mortality rate (1 - 2%)
* **Truncal Vagotomy with Drainage Procedure**
* **Highly Selective Vagotomy (HSV)**
  * Highest recurrence rate (5 - 15%)
  * Lowest postoperative morbidity (5 - 8%)
  * Lowest mortality rate

#### Johnson Classification of Gastric Ulcers

![johnson-classification](/assets/2014-10-13-benign-gastric-diseases/johnson_classification.png)

* **Type I**
  * Most common (60%)
  * Not thought to be related to acid hypersecretion
  * Associated with *H. pylori* infection however full etiology is unclear
  * **Billroth I** is procedure of choice
  * **Billroth II** or **Roux-en-Y** may be necessary due to anatomy
* **Type II**
  * **2** ulcers: along Incisura and in Duodenum
  * **Billroth I with Vagotomy** is preferred
  * **Billroth II with Vagotomy** or **Roux-en-Y** may be necessary due to inability to mobilize Duodenum due to involvement by ulcer
* **Type III**
  * Prepyloric location
  * **Billroth I with Vagotomy** is preferred
  * **Billroth II with Vagotomy** or **Roux-en-Y** may be necessary due to inability to mobilize Duodenum due to involvement by ulcer
  * **Full-thickness Excision with Highly Selective Vagotomy** is an alternative
    * Not recommended unless surgeon has considerable experience
    * Higher rates of recurrence due to leaving behind Gastrin-secreting tissue
* **Type IV**
  * Proximally located along Lesser Curvature near Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ)
  * Not thought to be related to acid hypersecretion
  * Goal of resection to maximize length of healthy gastric tissue to enable gastroduodenostomy
    * **Pauchet Procedure**
      * Distal gastrectomy with extension along the Lesser Curvature + Billroth I
      * Ulcers 2 - 5 cm from GEJ
    * **Csendes Procedure**
      * Subtotal gastrectomy + Roux-en-Y
      * Ulcers &lt; 2 cm from GEJ
* **Type V**
  * Can affect any portion of the stomach
  * Thought to be related to **NSAID** use
  * Cessation of NSAID and medical therapy (PPI or H2 blocker)
  * Bleeding is the most common complication
  * **Endoscopy with Injection or Cautery** is first line treatment
  * **IR localization of bleeding vessels with Embolization** is second line treatment
  * Surgical approach is for refractory cases
    * **Anterior Gastrostomy** to insepct mucosa with **Oversewing** of major bleeding sites
    * **Total Gastrectomy** can be life-saving

#### Giant Ulcers

* Gastric: &gt; 3 cm in diameter
* Duodenal: &gt; 2 cm in diameter
* 30% of Giant Ulcers harbor malignant disease
* Endoscopy with at least 12 biopsies of edge and base of ulcer (4 jumbo forceps, 8 regular forceps)

#### Marginal Ulcers

* Ulcers that affect the perianastomotic region following Gastrojejunostomy
* Usually seen after Gastric Bypass surgery for Morbid Obesity
* **Retained or Excluded Antrum** is no longer exposed to acid &#8594; **Hypergastrinemia** &#8594; further acid secretion
* May be due to incomplete Vagotomy
* May require conversion of **Billroth I** or **Billroth II** to **Roux-en-Y**

## Complications of Gastric and Duodenal Ulcers

#### Perforation

* Most common complication in Gastric Ulcers
* Most common fatal complication in Duodenal Ulcers
* Mostly found on anterior surface of Duodenum
* Subdiaphragmatic free air in 80 - 85% of XRs
* Aggressive fluid resuscitation
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics
* Prompt surgical repair
* **Duodenal Ulcers**
  * **Graham Patch** with postoperative *H. pylori* therapy (place JP in Hepatorenal Recess and watch for bilious drainage)
  * **Truncal Vagotomy with Drainage Procedure** in stable patient known to be *H. pylori* negative or who failed medical therapy
  * **Total Gastrectomy** is **RARELY** indicated due to the complications that arise
* **Gastric Ulcers**
  * **Wedge Resection with Oversewing** and specimen sent to pathology to exclude malignancy
  * **Graham Patch** with multiple **Biopsies** if ulcer is at a Juxtapyloric location that makes Wedge resection impossible

#### Hemorrhage

    * Acid-reducing procedure in the hemodynamically stable patient
    * *H. pylori* erradication postoperatively to reduce recurrent bleed
  * **Gastric Ulcers**
    * **Biopsy** to rule out malignancy
    * **Wedge Resection or Oversewing** in the hemodynamically unstable patient
    * **Vagotomy and Antrectomy** can be considered in the hemodynamically stable patient

#### Obstruction

* Most commonly caused by **Gastric Cancer**
* Least common complication of Gastric Ulcers
* 10% lifetime risk in untreated Duodenal Ulcers
* Can be due to acute inflammation and edema
* Must rule out Malignancy
* Also consider **GIST** and **Primary Lymphomas**
* Diagnosis
  * EGD
  * Will see *Hypochloremic Hypokalemic Alkalosis*
  * Alkalotic urine (compensatory secretion of HCO3-)
  * Paradoxic urinary acidosis (excrete H+ in exchange for K+ &#8594; conserves K+)
* Nasogastric decompression with fluid and electrolyte replacement
* IV PPI
* **Surgical Therapy** indicated if
  * Persistent obstruction after **7 days** of non-operative management
  * Recurrent obstruction
* Definite cure is resection and reconstruction
  * **Billroth I with Vagotomy** is the ideal
  * **Billroth II** or **Roux-en-Y** may be necessary if safe resection with tension-free anastomosis is not possible
* **Endoscopic Stenting with Dilatation** may be performed in patients that are poor surgical candidates

#### Vagotomies

* Goal is the Parasympathetic denervation of the acid-producing stomach tissue
* *See **[Vagotomies]({% post_url 2014-10-26-vagotomies %})***
  
#### Drainage Procedures

* Goal is to avoid outlet obstruction secondary to stricture
