* Orotracheal/nasotracheal intubation is contraindicated in severe laryngeal trauma -> immediate tracheostomy is warranted
* Bladder injury occurs in 3-10% of pelvic fracture patients
* Gross hematuria or &gt; 30 red blood cells per high-power field in setting of pelvic injury has higher predictive value
* Gastric mucosal pH is relfective of the adequacy of splanchnic perfusion
* Bladder injuries:
  * 60% extraperitoneal
  * 30% intraperitoneal
  * 10% combination
* Mannitol is contraindicated until hemodynamic stability is assured

### TBI Guidelines

#### Blood and Oxygenation
 
**Level I**

* There are insufficient data to support a Level I recommendation for this topic
 
**Level II**

* Blood pressure should be monitored and hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg) avoided
 
**Level III**

* Oxygenation should be monitored and hypoxia (PaO2 < 60 mmHg or O2Sat < 90% avoided)
 
 
**Miscellaneous**
 
* Predictors of outcome
  * SBP &lt; 90
  * Admission GCS
  * Admission GCS motor score
  * Intracranial diagnosis
  * Pupillary status
* Single episode of hypotension associated with increased morbidity and doubling of mortality
 
#### Hyperosmolar Therapy
 
**Level I**
 
* There are insufficient data to support a Level I recommendation for this topic
 
**Level II**
 
* Mannitol is effective for control of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) at doses of 0.25 - 1.0 g/kg
* Arterial hypotension (SBP &lt; 90 mmHg should be avoided)
 
**Level III**
 
* Restrict mannitol use prior to ICP monitoring to patients with signs of transtentorial herniation or progressive neurological deterioration not attributable to extracranial causes
 
**Miscellaneous**
 
* Mannitol can given to (1) cause immediate reduction of ICP to stabilize patient for further diagnostic/therapeutic tests/procedures or (2) as a constant therapy for elevated ICP
* There is no evidence to support its use as a continuous therapy
