## Esophageal Function Disorders

* **Motility (Peristalsis)**
* **Lower Esophageal Sphincter**
  * Functionality depends on **total length**, **pressure**, and **intraabdominal length**
  * **[Esophageal Manometry]()**
    * Overall length of LES
    * Abdominal length of LES
    * Pressure of LES
    * Peristaltic wave progression of LES
    * Contractility of LES
  * Abnormal Manometry values include
    * Pressure &lt; 5 mmHg
    * Overall length &lt; 2 cm
    * Abdominal length &lt; 1 cm
    * 1 abnormal value = 90% probability of having **GERD**
  * **Esophageal pH Testing**
    * 24-hour testing period (outpatient vs ambulatory)
    * Accompanying diary of body position, timing of meals, and other activities
    * Gold standard in diagnosis of GERD
    * **DeMeester Score**

## Lower Esophageal Sphincter Disorders

#### Hiatal Hernias

* *See **[Hiatal Hernias]({% post_url 2014-08-31-paraesophageal-hernia %})***

#### Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

* *See **[GERD]({% post_url 2014-10-26-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease %})***

#### Hypertensive Lower Esophageal Sphincter

* Hypertension of the LES
  * LES pressure &gt; 95 percentile of normal (&gt; 45 mm Hg)
  * Relaxation of LES present
* Normal peristalsis of esophagus present
* Results in symptoms of dysphagia or noncardiac chest pain
* **Diagnosis**
  * Esophageal Manometry
* **Treatment**
  * Medical Therapies
    * Calcium channel blockers
    * Nitrates
    * *Very* effective
  * Surgical Therapies
    * Myotomy and Fundoplication (e.g. **[Heller Myotomy]({% post_url 2014-10-24-heller-myotomy %})**)
    * **Nissen Fundoplication** if GERD is present
    * Surgery reserved for refractory symptoms

## Esophageal Motor Disorders

#### Achalasia

* Defective motility (absence of peristalsis)
* Failure of LES to relax
* Thought to be due to decreased number of *inhibitory ganglion cells*
* **Diagnosis**
  * Esophagram (Barium Swallow)
  * EGD
  * Esophageal Manometry
    * Incomplete/absent LES relaxation and absence of esophageal peristalsis
    * Gold standard
  * Must rule out **Pseudoachalasia** &#8594; conditions that can masquerade as Achalasia (e.g. **Malignancy**)
* **Treatment**
  * Medical therapies
    * Calcium channel blockers
    * Nitrates
    * Sildenafil
    * Limited to symptom relief in Early Achalasia
  * Endoscopic therapies
    * **Botulinum Toxin**
      * Injected endoscopically with sclerotherapy needle in 4 aliquots to each quadrant of the LES
      * Total of 100 units
      * Symptom recurrence typically in 1 - 4 months
      * Can cause submucosal scarring
      * Reserved for patients not willing to have other treatments or at high risk for other therapies (e.g. pneumatic dilation or surgery)
    * **Pneumatic dilatation**
      * Stretches and produces localized rupture of LES muscle fibers
      * Graded approach to dilation
      * 30 &#8594; 35 &#8594; 40 mm polyethylene balloon diameters
      * 7 - 15 psi
      * 15 - 60 seconds
      * Perforation rate of 4 - 7%
      * Typically have a post-procedure Contrast Esophagram to rule-out perforation
      * Can complicate subsequent surgical procedures
      * 50% success rate at 5 years
    * **Per-Oral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM)**
      * Submucosal injection of saline at midesophagus (13 cm from GEJ)
      * Submucosal tunnel created extending to 3 cm on Stomach
      * Dissection of circular muscle 7 cm from GEJ to 2 cm distal to GEJ
      * Mucosal entry site clipped with Hemostatic Clips or Fibrin Glue
      * No data on long-term success rate or adverse effects of POEM
  * Surgical therapies
    * **[Heller Myotomy]({% post_url 2014-10-24-heller-myotomy %})** with **[Antireflux Procedure]()**
    * Esophagectomy &#8594; in end-stage Achalasia or **Sigmoid Esophagus (Megaesophagus)**\

#### Sigmoid Esophagus (Megaesophagus)

* Sigmoid-shaped appearance
* Widened esophagus &gt; 6 cm diameter
* Traditionally Esophagectomy performed
* Successful outcomes with Myotomy and Dor Fundoplication also shown
  * 92% improvement in dysphagia
* Severe Sigmoid Esophagus likely will require Esophagectomy

#### Diffuse Esophageal Spasm

* *Functional obstruction* caused by simultaneous and uncoordinated muscular contractions
* Disordered rather than high pressure esophageal contraction
* Therapy aimed at relieving propulsive contractions and improving symptoms
* **Symptoms**
  * Non-cardiac chest pain
  * Globus
  * Dysphagia
  * Modest weight loss
  * Symptoms are sporadic, self-limiting, not associated with food intake, and occasionally associated with extreme food temperatures
* Patients present after negative cardiac workup for Angina Pectoris
* **[GERD]({% post_url 2014-10-26-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease %})** associated with 20 - 50% of patients diagnosed with DES
* Patients need GERD workup
* **Diagnosis**
  * **Esophageal Manometry**
    * Normal peristalsis
    * Intermittent loss of coordinated contractions &#8594; primarily in Lower Esophagus
    * Normal LES function
  * **Video Esophagram**
    * Still pictures may show "Corkscrew" or "Rosary Bead" pattern

    * Sildenafil
    * Tricyclic Antidepressants
    * Valium/Ativan
    * PPI &#8594; treatment of concommitant GERD
  * Surgical therapies
    * **Long Esophagomyotomy** (Stomach to Aortic arch) with **Antireflux Procedure** for refractory disease &#8594; high morbidity
      * Fundoplication if incision extended to GEJ
        * **Modified Belsey Fundoplication**
      * Muscle dissected for 50% of the circumference of the Esophagus to prevent recurrence
      
      > Care taken not to injure the Vagus Nerve
      
      * Improved quality of life in 70% of patients
      * Results not as good compared to Myotomy in Achalasia

#### Hypercontractile ("Nutcracker") Esophagus

* Increased intensity of esophageal contractions
* Normal peristalsis
* LES relaxes normaly
* Some patients transition to Classic Achalasia and thought to be part of a spectrum of disease including **Achalasia**
* High association with ***Psychologic issues***
  * 30% also have Psychiatric Illness
  * Overlap with **Irritable Bowel Syndrome**
* **Diagnosis**
  * Manometry
    * High pressure (&gt; 180 mm Hg) contractions or Long duration of swallow responses (&gt; 7 seconds)
* **Treatment**
  * Medical therapies
    * Calcium channel blockers
    * Nitrates
    * Sildenafil
    * Tricyclic Antidepressants
  * Surgical therapy avoided due to inconsistent outcomes
    * Long Thoracic Myotomy may relieve pain but result in worsening dysphagia

#### Ineffective Esophageal Motility

* Decreased distal esophageal peristaltic wave pressures (amplitudes &lt; 30 mm Hg) or absence of esophageal contractions in &gt; 30% of wet swallows
* Decreased resting LES pressures (compared to what is seen in Achalasia)
* **Treatment**
  * Lifestyle modification
  * Medical Therapies
    * PPIs
    * Prokinetic agents
  * Surgery is rarely indicated

## Secondary Esophageal Motility Disorders

#### Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)

* Autoimmune disorder that targets the distal third of the esophagus
* Esophageal symptoms in 1 - 25% of patients

  * Calcinosis
  * Raynaud's phenomena
  * Esophageal dysfunction
  * Sclerodactyly
  * Telangiectasia
* **Symptoms**
  * Dysphagia

* **Diagnosis** &#8594; often requires all modalities
  * Video Esophagram
    * Dilation and marked aperistalsis in distal third of Esophagus
  * 24-hour pH Probing
    * Reflux in up to 80% of patients

    * Surgical intervention reserved for
      * Failure of medical therapy
      * End-stage disease
      * Stricture
      * Perforation
    * **Partial Fundoplication**
      Minimizes risk of postoperative dysphagia in exchange for higher recurrence of reflux
    * **Collis Gastroplasty with Antireflux Procedure**
    * Considerations for *Steroid* and *Immunosuppressant Agents* typically used in these patients must be balanced
