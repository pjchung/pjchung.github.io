## Lower Esophageal Sphincter

* Functionality depends on **total length**, **pressure**, and **intraabdominal length**
* **Esophageal Manometry**
  * Overall length of LES
  * Abdominal length of LES
  * Pressure of LES
  * Peristaltic wave progression of LES
  * Contractility of LES
* Abnormal Manometry values include
  * Pressure &lt; 5 mmHg
  * Overall length &lt; 2 cm
  * Abdominal length &lt; 1 cm
  * 1 abnormal value = 90% probability of having **GERD**
* **Esophageal pH Testing**
  * 24-hour testing period (outpatient vs ambulatory)
  * Accompanying diary of body position, timing of meals, and other activities
  * Gold standard in diagnosis of GERD
  * **DeMeester Score**

## Esophagitis

| Grade II      | Discrete areas of erythema |
| Grade III     | Circumferential erosions |
| Grade IV      | GERD complications (ulcers, strictures, shortened esophagus, **Barrett Esophagus**) |

#### Los Angeles Classification

| Grade   | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Grade A       | &ge; 1 mucosal break &lt; 5 mm long that does not extend beyond the tops of 2 mucosal folds |
| Grade B       | &ge; 1 mucosal break &gt; 5 mm long that does not extend beyond the tops of 2 mucosal folds |
| Grade C       | &ge; 1 mucosal break that extends between the tops of &ge; 2 mucosal folds involving &lt; 75% of the esophageal circumference |
| Grade D       | &ge; 1 mucosal break involving &ge; 75% of the esophageal circumference |
