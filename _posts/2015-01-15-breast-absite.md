## Imaging

#### Mammogram
* Presence or absence of palpable mass, not BIRADS dictates whether biopsy should be performed
  * Palpable masses **should be biopsied**
* **Radial Scars** &#8594; **Complex Sclerosing Lesions**
  * Long, thin, radiating spicules with translucent central area of fat &#8594; "Black Star"
  * Is a **benign lesion** but is a **risk factor for malignancy** &#8594; Needle Biopsy indicated

#### MRI
* Recommended if
  * BRCA mutation present
  * &ge; 1 first-degree relative who is a BRCA carrier
  * &ge; 1 first-degree relative with genetic syndrome at high risk for breast cancer
    * Li-Fraumeni Syndrome
    * Cowden Disease
    * Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba Syndrome
  * Prior chest radiation between ages 10 - 30 years
  * &gt; 20% lifetime risk of developing Breast Cancer
* Not recommended if
  * &le; 15% lifetime risk of developing Breast Cancer

## Benign Diseases

#### Mondor's Disease
* Superficial thrombophlebitis of the vein of the breast
* Presents with acute onset of pain and tenderness
* **Palpable cord or hard mass** &#8594; confusion with **Breast Cancer**
* Treat with **NSAID** and **warm-compresses**
* Consider Mammogram to rule out underlying pathology

#### Mastitis
* Warm compresses
* Continue breast feeding
* PO Antibiotics
* **No I&D**
* Need to confirm that symptoms have resolved &#8594; otherwise need to rule out **Inflammatory Breast Cancer**

#### LCIS
* Marker for increased risk of malignancy in *either breast*
* Malignancies tend to develop 15 years after diagnosis of LCIS
  * Tends to be **Invasive Ductal Cancer**
* Incidental finding on biopsy for **other mammographic abnormalities**
  * Sometimes described as having **Neighborhood Calcification** on mammogram
* Treatment options
  1. Close surveillance
  1. **Tamoxifen**

  * Intermediate malignancy (15%)
  * Malignant (25%)
* Hematogenous spread &#8594; no indication for Lymph Node sampling
* Treatment options
  * Wide local exicsion with &ge; 1 cm margins &#8594; acceptable in both benign and malignant disease
    * Unlike in Fibroadenomas which can undergo Enucleation

## Malignant Diseases

#### DCIS
* 5-fold increase in risk of progression to **Invasive Breast Cancer**
* Histological types
  * Papillary
  * Micropapillary
  * Cribiform
  * Solid
  * Comedo
* Treatment options
  1. **Wide Local Excision with Negative Margins**
  1. **Mastectomy with Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy** &#8594; done to **reduce risk of recurrence**
    * Multicentric DCIS
    * Persistent positive-margins on wide-local excision
    * Large palpable lesions (&gt; 4 cm)
  * Tamoxifen (reduces risk of developing invasive cancer)
* Recurrence risks
  * Comedo histologic type
  * Excision margins &lt; 1 mm
  * Lesion &gt; 2.5 cm
  
#### Invasive Ductal Carcinoma
* Histology
  * **Tubular (best prognosis)** > Papillary/Medullary > Mucinous > **Scirrhotic (most common)**
* Risk factors
  * **Proliferative without Atypia** &#8594; 1.88 increase in risk of Breast Cancer
    * Ductal Hyperplasia
    * Papillomatosis
    * Radial Scar
    * Sclerosing Adenosis
  * **Proliferative with Atypia** &#8594; 4.24 increase in risk of Breast Cancer
    * Atypical Hyperplasia (Ductal or Lobular)

#### Inflammatory Breast Cancer
* Invasion of cancer cells to **subdermal lymphatics** &#8594; lymphatic obstruction and lymphedema
* Confused with ***Mastitis***
* At least **Stage IIIB** (is a **T4** lesion)
* Treatment options
  * **Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy** (Anthracyclines and Taxanes)
    * If response &#8594; Surgical Excision &#8594; Adjuvant Radiation and Hormone Therapy
    * If no response &#8594; Radiation Therapy &#8594; Surgical Excision

#### Paget's Disease of the Nipple
* Breast cancer that starts in the breast ducts near the nipple then spreads to the nipple
* Confused with **Eczema**
* Any periareolar rash that does not resolve should be evaluated
  * Biopsy
  * Mammogram &#8594; rule out underlying associated lesions
* **Paget Cell**
  * Large, pale, vacuolated cell
  * CEA positive on staining
* Treatment options
  * **Mastectomy and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy**
  * **Excision of Nipple Areolar complex with Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and Radiation**
    * &ge; 2 cm cone of retroareolar tissue
    * Only if confined clinically and radiographically to the nipple

#### Breast Lymphoma
* Localized (Low-grade)
  * Primary excision
* Diffuse (Intermediate/High-grade)

* 90% ER-positive
* &lt; 5% HER2/neu positive
* **Stage-for-stage** same prognosis as in female breast cancer

  * May require amputation of limb

## Hereditary Breast Cancer

* Prophylactic Simple Mastectomy does not completely eliminate risk of breast cancer
  * 90% risk reduction
