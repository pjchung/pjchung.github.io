## Overview

* Esophageal perforation is a **life-threatening** condition
* Mortality rate ranges from 10 - 40%
* Good outcomes are associated with good care
* **Causes**
  * *Instrumentation* (e.g. esophagoscopy, transesophageal echocardiography, pneumatic dilation, placement of intraesophageal tubes, traumatic intubation) &#8594; most common
  * Spontaneous (e.g. **Boerhaave's Syndrome**)
  * Foreign body perforations
  * Caustic ingestion
  * Postsurgical perforations
  * Trauma (blunt or penetrating)

## Diagnosis

* Esophagogram
  * Water-soluble study followed by Barium swallow study
* CT Chest

## Treatment

* Treatment is ultimately dictated by several factors
  * Location of the perforation
  * Contained vs uncontained perforation
  * Underlying disease processes (e.g. Malignancy or [Achalasia]({% post_url 2014-10-21-benign-esophageal-diseases %}))
  
#### Resuscitation

* *Broad spectrum antibiotics* and *antifungals* (gram-positive, gram-negative, and fungal coverage)
* *Nasogastric Tube* above the perforation at the time of Esophagogram
* Aggressive *IV Fluid* resuscitation &#8594; large amounts of Third Spacing due to Chemical Pleuritis or Peritonitis
* Monitoring Urine Output
* Possible *Chest tube* for drainage of pleural effusions

#### Cervical Perforation

* Cervical perforations should be drained unless there is clear drainage back into the Esophagus
* *Left-sided neck incision* at the anterior border of the Sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM)
* Retraction of the SCM and the Carotid Sheath laterally and medial retraction of the Thyroid

>  Care taken not to injure the **Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve**

* The *Retroesophageal space* is then entered bluntly along the *Prevertebral fascia* to the *Posterior Mediastinum*
* Drainage of all collections
* If the defect identified then it is **closed in layers** with *absorbable sutures*
* If the defect cannot be identified then a *drain* is placed &#8594; usually results in healing

#### Thoracic Perforation

* Open repair done quickly has a higher chance of successful healing
* *See Special Situations* for perforations involving the Esophagus with underlying disease
* **Small Perforation**
  * Can be managed with *Endoscopic Clips* and/or *Endoscopic Stents*
  * *Endoscopic Stents* useful after anastomotic leaks from **Esophagogastrectomy** provided the Gastric conduit has good blood supply
  * Associated collections must be well drained with *Chest tubes* or *Thoracoscopic debridement of pleura and drain placement* 
* **Upper Thoracic Perforation**
  * Primary Repair
    * **Right Thoracotomy at the 5th Interspace**
    * Dissection of the Esophagus to clearly identify the region of perforation
    * **Longitudinal Myotomy** to identify the extent of the Mucosal perforation 
    * Edges of perforation debrided
    * 40F to 48F *Bougie* placed
    * Closure of the defect **in layers** with *absorbable sutures*
    * **Muscle flap** to buttress the closure (e.g. vascularized intercostal muscle flap from 5th Interspace)
    * Placement of *chest tubes* adjacent to site of perforation
    * Creation of feeding tube (e.g. **Gastrostomy** or **Jejunostomy**)
  * *See below* for cases with a delayed presentation
* **Lower Thoracic Perforation**
  * Primary Repair
    * **Left Thoracotomy at the 7th Interspace**
    * Repair conducted as above
  * *See below* for cases with a delayed presentation
* **Delayed Presentation**
  * Consider **Cervical Esophagostomy with Gastrostomy**
  * Dissection of the Esophagus from an incision anterior to the SCM (*see above*)
  * Esophagus brought to the skin and **opened longitudinally** as a **Loop Esophagostomy**

#### Abdominal Perforation

* **Upper Midline Incision** (usual approach)
* **Left Lower Thoracotomy** &#8594; for the morbidly obese patient
* Primary repair conducted as above
  * Buttressing can be done with **Omentum** or **Fundus** (e.g. **Nissen** or **Thal** Fundoplications)

#### Special Situations

* **Malignancy**
  * If adequate drainage can be accomplished with *chest tubes*
    * Place *Chest tubes* &#8594; control Pleuritis
    * Place *Endoscopic stent* &#8594; control contamination
    * Perform Oncologic resection later
  * If adequate drainage **cannot** be accomplished
    * **Cervical Esophagostomy and Gastrostomy (for feeding)** &#8594; most likely course given massive contamination
      * Right Thoracotomy with patient later placed Supine for Gastrostomy
    * **Esophagectomy with Primary Anastamosis** &#8594; if safe to perform
* **Achalasia**
  * **Myotomy** must be performed as high intraluminal esophageal pressure may hinder healing
  * **Left Thoracotomy at the 7th Interspace**
  * Esophagus dissected out circumferentially
  
  > Care taken not to injure the **Vagi**
  
  * Longitudinal Myotomy performed on the opposite side of the Esophagus from the perforation
  * Perforation **closed in layers** with *absorbable sutures*
  * Perforation site **buttressed with Omentum**
  * *Nasogastric tube* left above repair site to suction for a week
* **Perforation After Nissen Fundoplication**
  * Immediate **Laparotomy**
  * Dismantling of the Fundoplication
  * Placement of a *40F Bougie* &#8594; prevents narrowing
  * Perforation **closed in layers** with *absorbable sutures*
  * Rewrap of the Nissen
* **Leakage of Esophagogastrostomy After Esophagectomy**
  * *Esophagoscopy* assess viability of the Gastric conduit
  * **Necrosis** of the Gastric Conduit
    * **Cervical Esophagostomy and Gastrostomy**
    * Gastric conduit is reduced back into the abdomen prior to creation of Gastrostomy
  * **Viable** Gastric Conduit
    * Placement of an *Endoscopic stent*
    * Drainage with *Chest tube*
  * Reconstruction of the Esophagus once patient has recovered
