## Hypothesis
* Ventilation with large tidal volumes causes trauma and inflammation thereby worsening ARDS
* Ventilation with low tidal volumes will reduce trauma and inflammation
* However ventilation with low tidal volumes may also respiratory acidosis and decrease arterial oxygenation

## Inclusion Criteria
* Intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation
* Acute decrease in P:F ratio &lt; 300
* No left atrial hypertension
* PWCP &le; 18 mmHg

## Exclusion Criteria
* &gt; 36 hours since above inclusion criterias met
* &lt; 18 years old
* Participated in other trials &lt; 30 days of meeting inclusion criteria
* Pregnant
* Increased intracranial pressure
* Neuromuscular disease (impairing spontaneous breathing)
* Sickle cell disease
* Severe chronic respiratory disease
* &gt; 1 kg/cm of height
* Condition with estimated 6 month mortality &gt; 50%
* Undergone bone marrow/lung transplant/chronic liver disease (Child-Pugh class C)
* Refusal of full life support

#### Ventilator Procedure
* Volume-assist control mode
* Predicted body weight (PBW) calculated
  * Males: PBW = 50 + 0.91[height (cm) - 152.4]
  * Females: PBW = 45.5 + 0.91[hieght (cm)]
* Tidal volumes
  * Traditional: 12 mL/kg of PBW
    * Plateau pressure &le; 50 cm H<sub>2</sub>O 
  * Trial: 6 ml/kg of PBW
    * Plateau pressure &le; 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O
    
#### Organ/System Failure
* Systolic BP &lt; 90 mm Hg
* Treat with vasopressors
* Platelet count &lt; 80,000 mm<sup>3</sup>
* Bilirubin &ge; 2 mg/decileter
* Creatinine &ge; 2 

#### Plasma Interleukin-6 Concentrations
*
