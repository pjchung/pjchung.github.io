#### Thyroglossal Duct Cyst and Sinus

* Most common congenital cervical anomaly
* Thyroglossal duct lumen starts to obliterate at week 5 and disappears by week 8
* Can occur anywhere along migratory path of thyroid
* 80% found juxtaposed to the Hyoid bone
* Pathology
  * Pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium and squamous epithelium
  * Heterotopic thyroid tissue
* Thyroglossal Duct Sinuses result from infection of the Cyst
* 1 - 2 cm smooth, well defined midline neck mass that moves upward with tongue protrusion
* Treated with teh _Sistrunk Procedure_
  * En bloc cystectomy
  * Excision of the central Hyoid bone
* 1% of Thryoglossal Duct Cysts contain cancer
  * 85% Papillary
  * Medullary Thyroid Cancer is *NOT* found in Thyroglossal Duct Cysts

## Salivary Gland Tumors

#### Benign

#### Epithelial

* Pleomorphic Adenoma (80%)
* Monomorphic Adenoma 
* Warthin's Tumor
* Oncocytoma
* Sebaceous Neoplasm

#### Nonepithelial

* Hemangioma
* Neural Sheath Tumor
* Lipoma

#### Treatment

* Superficial Parotidectomy with Facial Nerve preservation
* Enucleation is **NOT** recommended due to risk of spillage and problematic recurrence

## Malignant

* Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma (most common in adults and pediatrics)
  * Low-grade: mostly mucin-secreting cells
  * High-grade: mostly epidermoid cells
* Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (second most common)
  * Neural skip lesions
  * High propensity for distant metastases but indolent local growth
* Acinic Cell Carcinoma (common in pediatrics)
