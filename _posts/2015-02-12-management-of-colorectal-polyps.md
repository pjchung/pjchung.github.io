## Overview

#### Definitions

* Colorectal polyp = macroscopically visible lesion or mass with pathologic epithelial elevation of colonic mucosa

## Pathophysiology

#### Hyperplastic Polyps
* Non-neoplastic
* Normal epithelial cells accumulating on mucosal surface and appear pale and sessile
* Most commonly found in Rectum
* Risk factors for malignancy
  * Large size (&gt; 1 cm)
  * Right colon lesions
  * Mixed adenoma/hyperplastic histology
  * &gt; 20 hyperplastic colonic polyps
  * Familial Hyperplastic Polyposis
  * Family history of Colon Cancer

#### Serrated Adenomas
* Large
* Right-sided
* Tendancy to occur in females
* Oncogenic pathway involves *BRAF* gene and DNA methylation

#### Hamartomas
* Outgrowth of normal mature cells originating from below the mucosa
* **Sporadic**
  * **Juvenile Polyps** &#8594; relatively common in children
* **Autosomal Dominant Familial**
  * **Peutz-Jegher's Syndrome**
    * Perioral hyperpigmentation
    * Multiple hamartomas in small bowel or large bowel
    * 2 - 13% risk of GI cancers
    * Regular endoscopic surveillance
  * **Juvenile Polyposis**
    * Young patient with &ge; 10 hamartomous GI polyps
    * 50% risk of Colon Cancer
    * 4th decade of life
  * **Cowden's Syndrome (Multiple Hamartoma Syndrome)**
    * Hamartomous lesions
      * Skin
      * GI tract
      * Bones
      * CNS
      * Eyes
      * GU tract
    * Malignancy risks
      * Skin Cancer
      * Thyroid Cancer
      * Endometrial Cancer
      * Breast Cancer
      * Colorectal Cancer

#### Adenomas
* Most common neoplastic polyps (50 - 65% of all polyps)
* Average risk aged &ge; 50 years &#8594; 10 - 25% prevalence
* Adenomas unlike Hyperplastic Polyps have *cellular atypia*

> Identification of Adenoma on Sigmoidoscopy is indication for complete Colonoscopy

* Histology
  * **Tubular** (65 - 85%)
  * **Tubulovillous** (10 - 25%)
  * **Villous** (10%)
* Advanced Adenomas (3.5 - 9.5%)
  * &gt; 1 cm
  * Villous architecture
  * Severe dysplasia
  * Carcinoma
* Risk of Colorectal Cancer in unresected polyps
  * 5 years &#8594; 4%
  * 10 years &#8594; 14%
* Risk of Colorectal Cancer
  * Benign appearing &#8594; 5% contain cancer
  * &gt; 2 cm &#8594; 30% chance of containing cancer

#### Malignant Polyp
* Adenocarcinoma invades into but no deeper than submucosal layer (T1 lesion)
* Formal resection required to **harvest associated lymph nodes**
* Lymph node metastases in 8 - 15% of malignant polyps

| Location | Indication for Oncologic Bowel Resection |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| Colon    | Pedunculated Haggit level 4 lesion with invasion into distal third of mucosa or pedunculated lesion with lymphovascular invasion |
|          | Lesion removed with margin &lt; 2 mm |
|          | Sessile lesion removed piecemeal |
|          | Sessile lesion with depth of invasion into distal third of submucosa (Sm3) |
|          | Sessile lesion with lymphovascular invasion |
| Upper Rectum | Same indications as in Colon |
| Middle Rectum | Same indications as in Colon |
| Distal Rectum | Pedunculated Haggit level 4 with invasion into distal submucosa or pedunculated lesion with lymphovascular invasion |
|               | All sessile lesions |

#### Sessile Villous Adenomas
* Frequently found in rectum
* **Transanal Excision** &#8594; distal Rectum
* **Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery (TEM)** &#8594; proximal Rectum
* **Transanal Minimally Invasive Surgery (TAMIS)** &#8594; proximal Rectum

## Treatment

#### Colonoscopic Polypectomy
* Techniques
  * Biopsy forceps
  * Snare polypectomy
  * Piecemeal excision
  * Submucosal lift
* Tattoo with India Ink sites of large or suspicious lesions
* **Relative Contraindications**
  * Anticoagulation therapy
  * Bleeding diathesis
  * Acute Colitis
  * Evidence of invasive malignancy
  * Inability to raise lesion with submucosal injecetion
* **Complications**
  * Death &#8594; 1 in 14,000
  * Bleeding &#8594; 4.8 in 1,000
  * Colonic Perforation &#8594; 1 in 1,000
  * Postpolypectomy Syndrome &#8594; 3 in 1,000
    * Cautery causes microperforations &#8594; Bacterial translocation
    * Present 0 to 3 days after colonoscopy
    * **NO** pneumoperitoneum
    * Localized peritonitis
  * Miss rate of cancer &#8594; &lt; 5%

* Guidelines for screening for Colorectal Cancer after Polypectomy

| Risk Category | Recommended colonoscopy interval |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| 1 - 2 small tubular adenomas | 5 - 10 years |
| 3 - 10 small adenomas | 3 years |
| 1 adenoma &gt; 1 cm | 3 years |
| Polyp with villous or high-grade dysplasia | 3 years |
| &gt; 10 adenomas | &lt; 3 years |
| Sessile adenomas removed piecemeal | 3 - 6 months |
