## Uncomplicated Diverticulitis
* Antibiotics (IV vs PO)
* Lifestyle modification
  * High fiber diets
* Colonoscopy
  * Rule out malignancy in older patients
* Perform colectomy after **fourth episode** (rather than second episode)
  * 1% fewer deaths
  * 2% fewer colostomies
  * Saves $5429 per patient

## Complicated Diverticulitis


#### Hinchey Classification

<table>
  <thead>
    <th style="width:25%">Stage</th>

  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>Stage I</td>
    <td>Confined pericolic abscess</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Stage II</td>
    <td>Distant abscess (retroperitoneal or pelvic)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Stage III</td>
    <td>Purulent peritonitis caused by rupture of  pericoloic or pelvic absccess (noncommunicating)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Stage IV</td>
    <td>Fecal peritonitis caused by free perforation of a diverticulum (communicating)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Hinchey I
* Drainage of smaller mesocolic absccesses can be definitive treatment
* Elective resection of sigmoid to proximal rectum and colorectal anastomosis
  * Immunosuppressed
  * Transplant patient
  * Pelvic abscess drainage

#### Hinchey II
* Laparoscopic irrigation and drainage
  * Laparoscopic irrigation of peritoneal cavity with 4 L warm saline solution
  * Place 2 penrose drains in vicinity of perforation

#### Hinchey III
* Emergent operative management
  * Sigmoid resection with colostomy and closure of distal rectum (**[Hartmann\'s Procedure]()**)
  * Creation of mucous fistula
  * Damage-control surgery
    * Unstable patient on pressors
    * Return to OR within 24-48 hours for Hartmann\'s Procedure
  * Laparoscopic irrigation and drainage
    * Laparoscopic irrigation of peritoneal cavity with 4 L warm saline solution
    * Place 2 penrose drains in vicinity of perforation
  * Primary anastomosis and diverting loop ileostomy
    * Hemodynamically stable patient
    * Well-vascularized end of colon
    * Tension-free anastomosis
  
#### Hinchey IV
* Emergent operative management
  * Damage-control surgery
  * Hartmann\'s Procedure
  * Creation of mucous fistula
 
## Bleeding Diverticulitis
* Criteria for surgery
  * Requires > 4 units RBC in 24-hour period
  * Continue to bleed after 72 hours
  * Experience rebleed within 1 week
* Localize bleed
  * Rule out Upper GI Bleed
  * Localize the Lower GI Bleed
    * Mesenteric Angiography
    * Triple-phase CTA
    * Radionuclide Scanning
* **[Subtotal colectomy]()**
  * High rebleeding rate (up to 42%)
  * Reserved for hemodynamically unstable patient without localization of bleeding
