# Uncomplicated Diverticulitis
* Antibiotics (IV vs PO)
* Lifestyle modification
  * High fiber diets
* Colonoscopy
  * Rule out malignancy in older patients
* Perform colectomy after **fourth episode** (rather than second episode)
  * 1% fewer deaths
  * 2% fewer colostomies
  * Saves $5429 per patient

# Complicated Diverticulitis


#### Hinchey Classification

| Stage I   | Confined pericolic abscess |
| Stage II  | Distant abscess (retroperitoneal or pelvic) |
| Stage III | Purulent peritonitis caused by rupture of  pericoloic or pelvic absccess (noncommunicating) |
| Stage IV  | Fecal peritonitis caused by free perforation of a diverticulum (communicating) |

### Hinchey I
* Drainage of smaller mesocolic absccesses can be definitive treatment
* Elective resection of sigmoid to proximal rectum and colorectal anastomosis
  * Immunosuppressed
  * Transplant patient
  * Pelvic abscess drainage

### Hinchey II
* Laparoscopic irrigation and drainage
  * Laparoscopic irrigation of peritoneal cavity with 4 L warm saline solution
  * Place 2 penrose drains in vicinity of perforation

### Hinchey III
* Emergent operative management
  * Sigmoid resection with colostomy and closure of distal rectum (**Hartmann\'s Procedure**)
  * Creation of mucous fistula
  * Damage-control surgery
    * Unstable patient on pressors
    * Return to OR within 24-48 hours for Hartmann\'s Procedure
  * Laparoscopic irrigation and drainage
    * Laparoscopic irrigation of peritoneal cavity with 4 L warm saline solution
    * Place 2 penrose drains in vicinity of perforation
  * Primary anastomosis and diverting loop ileostomy
    * Hemodynamically stable patient
    * Well-vascularized end of colon
    * Tension-free anastomosis
  
### Hinchey IV
* Emergent operative management
  * Damage-control surgery
  * Hartmann\'s Procedure
  * Creation of mucous fistula
 
# Bleeding Diverticulitis
* Criteria for surgery
  * Requires > 4 units RBC in 24-hour period
  * Continue to bleed after 72 hours
  * Experience rebleed within 1 week
* Localize bleed
  * Rule out Upper GI Bleed
  * Localize the Lower GI Bleed
    * Mesenteric Angiography
    * Triple-phase CTA
    * Radionuclide Scanning
* Subtotal colectomy
  * High rebleeding rate (up to 42%)
  * Reserved for hemodynamically unstable patient without localization of bleeding
