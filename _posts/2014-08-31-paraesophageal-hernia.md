## Epidemiology

* First described by **Henry Ingersoll Bowditch** in 1853
* Prevalence of 10-60%
* Sliding esophageal hernias = 95%
* Paraesophageal Hernias (PEH) = 5%
* Increasing incidence in late-middle aged and older individuals (>50 years)

    <td>Most common</td>
    <td>Combination of sliding hernias and Type II where both GEJ and cranial portion of stomach cross esophageal hiatus</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Type IV</b></td>
    <td>Herniation of another abdominal organ (e.g. spleen, small intestine, colon) with stomach</td>
    <td>Increased intraabdominal pressure in presence of large hiatal defect with laxity of gastrosplenic and gastrocolic ligaments</td>

## Terminology

* **_Giant Paraesophageal Hernia_** = hiatal hernia in which 30% or more of stomach is herniated into the thorax
* **_Parahiatal Hernia_** = herniation of stomach into thorax through a defect other than esophageal hiatus
* **_Cameron Ulcer_** = ulceration due to repeated friction between engorged gastric mucosa and food as it passes through the hiatus
* **_Borchardt's Triad_** = Described in 1904
  1. Epigastric/chest pain
  1. Retching without vomiting
  1. Inability to pass nasogastric tube
* **[Collis Gastroplasty]()** = esophageal lengthening procedure
  * 52F to 54 bougie placed along lesser curvature
  * Endo GIA used to divide from greater curvature down to bougie and 5 cm from GEJ
  * Wedge of stomach removed by dividing along bougie to GEJ
  * Remaining fundus and body of stomach advanced cephalad to form fundoplication around newly constructed gastroplasty tube
  * Small but significant risk of staple-line leakage

## Complications

* **Gastric Volvulus**
  * Organoaxial rotation (most frequent)
    * Rotation horizontally around an axis passing through GEJ and pylorus with antrum rotating opposite direction to fundus
  * Mesenteroaxial rotation
    * Rotation vertically so that posterior surface of stomach progressively presents anteriorly
  * Combined rotation (rare)
* **Shortened Esophagus**
  * Believed that acquired shortening of esophagus caused by repeated acid-related damage to lower esophageal wall
  * Subsequent healing and reinjury leads to fibrotic remodeling
  
## Diagnosis

* CXR (incidental finding)
  * Shadow in posterior mediastinum
  * Retrocardiac mass with/without air-fluid level
* **Barium contrast fluoroscopy**
  * Can show presence of PEH in nearly all patients
  * Provides anatomical information and orientation of stomach and location of GEJ
  * Helps select patients with **esophageal motor dysfunction**
    * Uncoordinated contractility of the esophageal body
    * Poor esophageal clearance of contrast
* Upper endoscopy
  * Assessment of the intrathoracic stomach
  * Visualization of Cameron ulcers and evaluation of esophageal/gastric mucosa
  * Rule out cancer
* Esophageal manometry/High-resolution manometry (HRM)
  * Intraluminal pressures
  * Lower esophageal sphincter function
  * Coordinated contractile movements of the esophagus
  * Guides choice of **[antireflux procedure]({)**
* CT scan

## Therapy

* **Symptomatic hernia = surgical repair**
  * Gastric volvulus is an emergency
  * Emergent NGT placement should _always_ be attempted
* Risks outweigh benefits for repair of **asymptomatic** PEH in patients >65 years
* \"Watchful waiting\" for asymptomatic/minimally symptomatic patients 

#### Surgical Principles

* Maintaining Crural Integrity
  * Prevent recurrence
* Preserving other existing structures
* Reduction of intrathoracic structures only possible by dissecting hernia sac off mediastinum
  * Remain in avascular plane during dissection
  * The reduced sac can be excised with preservation of the vagus
  * Proper and complete sac dissection minimizes surgical handling of the crura
* At least 2.5 - 3 cm of tension-free distal esophagus necessary
  * Extended mediastinal dissection up to level of _inferior pulmonary veins_ may be necessary to get adequate intraabdominal esopageal length
  * **Collis gastroplasty** is performed when intraabdominal esopageal length is not adequate
* Antireflux barrier
  * **Partial posterior fundoplication** preferred to complete wrap
    * Wrap performed around a 54F or 56F bougie
* Anterior gastropexy performed to decrease recurrence
* Permanent meshes are no longer widely used
* Biologic meshes decrease short-term recurrence but not long-term recurrence
* Transthoracic approach
  * Less recurrence compared to transabdominal approach
  * "Short esophagus" more likely to be found with more esophageal lengthening procedures
    * More risk of staple leak
* Transabdominal approach
  * Less postoperative pain and morbidity compared to transthoracic approach

#### Surgical Anatomy

* Esophageal hiatus
  * Right crus = muscular fibers
  * Median arcuate ligament = ligament connecting right and left crus
* Phrenoesophageal ligament (**Laimer's membrane**)
  * Maintains proximity between esophagus and stomach
  * Allows some vertical sliding
  * Laxity in the setting of an enlarged hiatus can result in a sliding hiatal hernia
* Existing structures crossing esophageal hiatus with esophagus
  * Anterior/posterior vagal trunks
  * Esophageal branches of left gastric artery/vein
  * Lymphatic vessels
* Existing structures in close proximity to esophageal hiatus
  * Thoracic duct
  * Celiac ganglia
  * Phrenic artery/vein
  * Mediastinal pleura
  * Aberrant left hepatic artery (arises from left gastric artery)
* Fat pad surrounding GEJ
  * Careful dissection during repair of PEH to enhance visualization and mobility
* Mesoesophagus
  * Present in posterior gap between esophagus, aorta, and diaphragmatic pillars
  * Prolonged inferiorly by **gastrophrenic ligament** which needs to be dissected when gastric fundus is mobilized
