## Overview

#### Epidemiology

* Prevalence of 8% in adults &gt; 60 years
* Rupture leads to 15,000 deaths annually
* **[Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR)]()** is usually the preferred method of treatment
* Some situations where Open Surgical Repair (OSR) preferred (*see below*)

#### Pathophysiology

* Causes
  * Degenerative (90%)
    * **Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)**
  * Inflammatory (5%)
    * Infection (e.g. *Chlamydia pneumonia*)
    * Autoimmune processes (e.g. B-type lymphocytes, plasma cells, immunoglobulin)
  * Idiopathic (5%)
* Location
  * Suprarenal (5%)
  * Infrarenal (95%)
    * Iliac artery involvement (25%)
    * Femoral or Popliteal artery involvement (4%)
    * Renal or other visceral artery involvement (2%)
* Risk for **rupture** correlates with wall tension as per ***Laplace's Law***
  * T = p &times; **r**
* Risk Factors associated with Rupture
  * Female gender
  * Increased Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)
  * Current smoking
  * Decreased Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1)
  * Aneurysm size
  
## Diagnosis

* Usually detected incidentally or via screening
  * **Ultrasound** &#8594; preferred modality for surveillance
  * **CT Scan** &#8594; preferred modality for preoperative planning
    * Better delineation of vascular anatomy
    * Evaluation of EVAR landing zones
    * Presence of aberrant vessels and Renovascular and Aortoiliac disease
* Usually asymptomatic
* **Symptoms**
  * Thromboembolic symptoms (e.g. lower digit ischemia)
  * Pulsatile sensation in chest, abdomen, or back
  * Compression symptoms
    * Ureters &#8594; Hydronephrosis
    * Bowel or Stomach &#8594; early satiety or obstructive symptoms
  * AAA rarely presents with **Aortic Dissection**
    * Mandates immediate repair &#8594; high risk of Rupture
  * ** AAA Rupture**
    * Severe abdominal or back pain
    * Hemodynamic instability *if uncontained rupture*

## Treatment

#### Indications for AAA Repair

* &gt; 5.5 cm diameter in males
* &gt; 5.0 cm diameter in females
* Growth &gt; 0.5 cm in 6 months
* Symptomatic AAA

#### Medical Management

* Control of Hypertension
* Control of COPD
* Smoking cessation
* ***Doxycycline*** may retard aneurysm growth by inhibiting **MMPs**

#### Indications for Open AAA Repair

* Hostile neck
* Neck &lt; 1.5 cm
* Significant angulation of the neck (&gt; 60&deg;)
* Suprarenal aneurysm
* Young patient (relatively)
* Endovascular capabilities not available
