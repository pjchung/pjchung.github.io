### Nutrition

* 6.25 g Protein = 1.0 g Nitrogen
* Normal energy expendeture
  * Proteins: 15%
  * Carbohydrates: 40 - 60%
  * Lipids: 25 - 45%
* Minimum 400 kcals (100 g) of carbohydrates/day required to avoid *protein breakdown*
* **Glucagon** causes proteolysis, glycogenolysis, lipolysis, and glycogen formation
* **Cholecystokinin** causes Gallbladder contraction
* **Secretin** causes pancreatic enzyme release
* Micelle formation required for fats to cross mucosal barrier
* Lipolysis stimulation
  * Steroids
  * Catecholamines
  * **Glucagon**
* Lipolysis inhibition
  * **Insulin**
* Lineoleic acid --> Arachidonic acid --> Prostaglandins
* TPN
  * Start with approximately 1000 kcal provided the first day then increased over the next 2 - 3 days
  * TPN can be discontinued if the patient can provide 75% of caloric needs via PO or is receiving %lt; 1000 kcal/day
* Large parenteral sodium load in severely malnourished patient may cause CHF
* Long-term complications of prolonged TPN use
  * Hepatic dysfunction --> Cirrhosis
  * Acalculous Cholecystitis
* **Refeeding Syndrome** can first manifest as respiratory distress (low phosphate causes diaphgram contraction abnormalities)
* Analgesia in burn patients can decrease the neuroendocrine response resulting in deaccelerating the metabolic rate and decreasing catabolic protein loss
* **Respiratory Quotient (RQ)** is the ratio between CO2 production and O2 consumption
  * RQ 0.67 = Lipid-only diet
  * RQ 1.0 = Carbohydrate-only diet
  * RQ &gt; 1.0 = excess caloric intake
  * Higher RQ results in increased CO2 production and greater difficulty weaning from ventilator
* Cirrhotic patients receiving **Branch-Chain Amino Acids (BCAA)** have significant decrease in
  * Progression of liver failure
  * Development of Liver Cancer
  * Rupture of Esophageal Varices
  * Shown in randomized controlled trial involving 646 Cirrhotics *(Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 2005;3:705)*
* **Megestrol (Megace)** improves food intake, fat gain, and patient mood in cancer patients, but does not alter outcomes
* **Short Gut Syndrome** occurs in patients with &lt; 180 cm of functional small bowel
* TPN independence requires
  * &gt; 120 cm of small bowel without colon
  * &gt; 60 cm of small bowel with some colonic continuity
  * Ileocecal valve salvage improves outcomes
* **Somatropin** (recombinant human growth hormone) is FDA approved to assist in weaning patients from parenteral nutrition
