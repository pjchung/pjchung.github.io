* Mutation of the _erb_ protooncogene (_HER-2_ = _erb-2_) results in defective EGFR
* EGFR expression in Breast Cancer is associated with a poor prognosis
* _Trastuzumab_ and _Cetuximab_ are human monoclonal antibodies that block EGFR
* There are 3 _Ras_ proteins (_h-ras_, _k-ras_, _n-ras_)
* _Ras_ is involved with GTP-binding
* Transforming Growth Factor-&beta; (_TGF-&Beta;_) inhibits cell growth
* _Interferon-&alpha; 2&beta;_ is the only approved adjuvant therapy for Melanoma
* _Interferon-&gamma;_ is used for Hairy Cell Leukemia
* Neuroblastoma in children is associated with spontaneous regression
* MEN-IIB is associated with _k-ras_ mutation
* _DCC_ (deleted in colon cancer) gene mutation causes interference in cellular adhesion
* Northern blotting detects expression of genes (presence of mRNA)
* High dose Interleukin-2 (_IL-2_) therapy is effective for Renal Cell Carcinoma and Melanoma


### Male Breast Cancer

* &lt; 1% of all breast cancers
* Peak incidence at 6th decade (age 68)
* Risk factors
  * Family history
    * BRCA 2 &gt; BRCA 1 (6% vs 1% lifetime risk)
  * Radiation exposure
  * Estrogen therapy
  * Testicular Feminizing Syndrome (androgen insensitivity)
  * _Klinefelter's Syndrome (XXY)_
* Preceeded by Gynecomastia in 20% of men
  * Gynecomastia is a benign condition
  * Has similar risk factors as male breast cancer
* Stage for stage has similar survival with female breast cancer
* Worse outcomes because males usually are diagnosed with advanced disease (Stage III or IV)
* DCIS &lt; 15%
* Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma &ge; 85%
* 80% are hormone receptor positive - consider adjuvant _Tamoxifen_
* Systemic chemotherapy considered for
  * Hormone receptor negative
  * Large primary tumors
  * Multiple positive nodes
  * Locally advanced disease
