## Overview
* Laxity of the LES
* Indications for surgical therapy are narrow due to medical therapy
* Proper patient selection is the key

## Operative Indications

* GERD refractory to pharmacologic therapy with physiologic testing showing pathologic acid reflux correlating to patient's symptoms
* Ideal candidates show a response to medical therapy but are unwilling/unable to take daily medication
* Complications of GERD
  * Severe **Esophagitis**
  * Benign stricture
  * Barrett's Esophagus (without high-grade dysplasia)
  * Bleeding
  * Ulceration
* Atypical symptoms of GERD
  * Chest pain
  * Asthma
  * Chronic cough
  * Recurrent pneumonia
  * Aspiration
  * Chronic bronchitis

#### Savary-Miller Classification of Esophagitis

| Grade   | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Grade I       | Normal mucosa |
| Grade II      | Discrete areas of erythema |
| Grade III     | Circumferential erosions |
| Grade IV      | GERD complications (ulcers, strictures, shortened esophagus, **Barrett Esophagus**) |

#### Los Angeles Classification of Esophagitis

| Grade   | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Grade A       | &ge; 1 mucosal break &lt; 5 mm long that does not extend beyond the tops of 2 mucosal folds |
| Grade B       | &ge; 1 mucosal break &gt; 5 mm long that does not extend beyond the tops of 2 mucosal folds |
| Grade C       | &ge; 1 mucosal break that extends between the tops of &ge; 2 mucosal folds involving &lt; 75% of the esophageal circumference |
| Grade D       | &ge; 1 mucosal break involving &ge; 75% of the esophageal circumference |

## Contraindications to Surgical Therapy

#### Absolute Contraindications

* **[Esophageal cancer]({% post_url 2014-10-26-malignant-esophageal-diseases %})**
* Barrett's Esophagus with untreated high-grade dysplasia
* Portal Hypertension
* Inability to tolerate anesthesia
* High surgical risk due to comorbidities

#### Relative Contraindications

* Obesity &#8594; decreases durability of **[antireflux procedure]({% post_url 2014-10-24-antireflux-procedures %})**
  * BMI &gt; 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> should undergo **[bariatric procedures]({% post_url 2014-10-26-bariatric-procedures %})**
* Lack of Surgeon experience

## Preoperative Workup

* Patients with typical symptoms have better outcomes after antireflux surgery
  * Heartburn
  * Regurgitation
  * Symptoms when supine
* **Endoscopy**
  * Up to 95% specificity
  * Biopsy of mucosa &#8594; rules out Barrett's Esophagus
* **Upper GI Series**
  * Gastric morphology
  * Gastric size
  * Length of esophagus &#8594; to rule out **\"Short Esophagus\"**
  * Presence of a **[Hiatal Hernia]({% post_url 2014-08-31-paraesophageal-hernia %})**
* **[Esophageal Manometry]({% post_url 2014-10-24-esophageal-manometry %})**
  * Rule out presence of other diseases in which antireflux surgery may be contraindicated (e.g. Achalasia)
  * Guides degree of fundoplication &#8594; incomplete wrap in a patient with disordered peristalsis or low-amplitude contractions
* **Ambulatory pH Monitoring**
  * 24-hour pH testing
  * pH probe needs to be 5 cm above LES (determined by manometry)
  * Antiacid medication needs to be discontinued at least a week before the test
* *Establishing a solid cause-effect relationship results in good surgical outcomes*

## Surgical Principles

* **Laparoscopic Transabdominal** approach is the preferred approach for a **Primary** antireflux procedure
* **Transthoracic or Open** approach are reserved for a **Revisional** antireflux procedure

#### Types of Fundoplications

| Type | Procedure Name | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| Complete Fundoplication | Nissen         | 360 degree wrap |
| Partial Fundoplication  | Toupet         | 270 degree wrap |
|                         | Anterior Fundoplication | 180 degree or 90 degree wrap |
|                         | Hill Repair    | Recreation of Angle of His<sup>\*</sup> and Posterior Gastropexy |
|                         | Belsey Mark IV | Transthoracic 240 degree wrap |

Angle of His = 6

#### Surgical Pitfalls

* **Bleeding**
* **Short Esophagus**
  * Result of chronic reflux disease with recurring cycles of inflammation and healing with subsequent fibrosis
  * Extensive mediastinal mobilization
  * Complete reduction of Hiatal Hernia
  * Lengthening procedure (*see **[Collis Gastroplasty]({% post_url 2014-10-26-collis-gastroplasty %})***)
* **Esophageal** or **Gastric Perforation**
  * Thermal damage
  * Excessive traction
  
## Postoperative Care

* No NGT
* No Foley
* Minimal narcotics
* Clear liquid diet on POD 1
* Discharged on POD 1
* Full liquid diet for 1 week
* Patients with chest pain, retching, unexplained tachycardia should be imaged to rule out **herniated wrap**

#### Postoperative Complications

* **Dysphagia**
  * Expected &#8594; reason why patients are kept on a full liquid diet
  * Will resolve with time
  * Dysphagia persisting &gt; 12 weeks is concerning
    * Diagnosis
      * **Upper GI Series** to evaluate the wrap
    * Treatment
      * Endoscopic dilatation
      * Surgical revision of the fundoplication
* **Gas Bloat Syndrome**
  * Recurrent abdominal pain and distention caused by air trapping in the stomach
  * Not as commonly encountered due to use of short and floppy wraps or partial fundoplication procedures
  * Diagnosis
    * Plain Abdominal X-Ray
    * Confirmed by relief of symptoms after placing an NGT
  * Treatment
    * Dietary modification
    * Prokinetic agents
    * Conversion of full fundoplication to a partial fundoplication

#### Reoperation

* Failure rate of 5 - 30%
* Most commonly for **\"Slipped\" Fundoplication** or **herniation of fundoplication into mediastinum**
* Complete restoration of normal anatomy before any revision is performed
* Low threshold to convert to an open procedure
