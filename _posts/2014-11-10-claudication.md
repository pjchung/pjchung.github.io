## Overview

* Claudication is experienced by approximately 50% of patients with **[Peripheral Artery Disease]()**
* Claudication is **NOT** a limb threatening disease (1 - 2% risk of limb loss per year)

## Diagnosis

* **Symptoms**
  * Pain occuring in musclar areas of the limbs (e.g. calf, thigh, buttock)
* Rule out other diseases
  * **Radiculopathy** &#8594; electric-like "shooting" pains
  * **Spinal Stenosis** &#8594; pain relieved only with sitting or leaning over
  * **Osteoarthritis/Rheumatoid Arthritis** &#8594; pain over joints, associated with weather
* Assess for *Limb-Threatening* problems
  * Rest pain
  * Non-healing wounds of the foot
* Evaluate comorbidities
  * Diabetes
  * Hypertension
  * Chronic Kidney Disease
  * Hyperlipidemia
  * Hyperhomocystinemia
  * Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
  * Chronic Heart Failure
  * Cerebral Vascular Disease
  * Coronary Artery Disease
  * Tobacco History
* **Diagnostic Workup**
  * Pulse exam
  * Inspect feet for ulcers
  * Systemic blood pressure
  * Ankle-Brachial Indices (ABIs)
  * *Anatomic imaging employed when decision to treat invasively is made*

## Treatment

#### Initial Medical Management

1. Minimize mortality from cerebrovascular events
  * **A**spirin
  * **B**eta Blockers
  * **C**holesterol management
  * **D**iabetes management
  * Control Tobacco use
1. Reduce risk of progression to critical limb ischemia
  * **Exercise** regimen is the ***first line therapy***
    * Doubles the pain-free walking distance of patients with claudication
    * Does not improve **macrovascular arterial circulation** and does **not** improve ABIs
    * Level 1 Grade B evidence
  * Weight loss
  * **Cilostazol**
    * Reversible Phosphodiesterase Inhibitor
    * Lifestyle-limiting claudication without CHF
    * 67% improvement in pain-free walking distance
    * Level A evidence
  * **Pentoxifylline**
    * Xanthine derivative that enhances RBC deformity
    * Small clinical improvements

#### Considerations for Invasive Therapy

* Generally accepted criteria:
  * Short distance claudication (&lt; 300 feet)
  * Claudication impairing employment
  * Claudication impairing Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)
* Other influencing factors:
  * Claudication with ABI &lt; 0.4
  * Toe pressure &lt; 40 mm Hg
  * Dependent rubor

#### Workup for Invasive Therapy

1. Evaluation and optimization of cardiopulmonary status
  * American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines for cardiac optimization
1. Imaging to delineate vascular anatomy to plan for revascularization

#### Invasive Therapy

* Deep Femoral Artery disease should be aggressively sought and treated
* Symptoms of claudication can improve with treatment of Aortoiliac disease alone *if* the Deep Femoral Artery is of good quality or reconstructed
* **Femoral-femoral bypass** and **Axillofemoral bypass** are alternatives to **Aortobifemoral bypass**
* Popliteal angioplasty (especially Popliteal stenting) is not recommended
  * Poor durability
  * Constrains further treatement options
* Patients that cannot have angioplasty/stenting or in whom endovascular approach has failed should consider bypass
* Good-caliber single-segment **Greater Saphenous Vein** leads to best long-term outcomes
  * Patients without a good **Greater Saphenous Vein** should probably be managed medically
  * Occluded vein graft bypasses only infrequently cause limb-threatening ischemia
  * **Occluded Prosthetic Grafts frequently cause limb-threatening ischemia**
* Patients need to be encouraged to quit smoking
  * Tobacco use is associated with a three to six-fold increase of prosthetic graft occlusion
