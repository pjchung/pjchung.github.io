## History

* First described by Ernst Heller in 1913

## Indications

* ***See [Benign Esophageal Disease]({% post_url 2014-10-21-benign-esophageal-diseases %})***
* Long term success is achieved in approximately 90 - 95% of patients undergoing Open Heller Myotomy
* **Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy** is comparable to Open
* Patients with a **Sigmoid Esophagus** should first undergo a Myotomy then Esophagectomy if the symptoms do not resolve
* Myotomy should extend from 4 - 8 cm on esophageal aspect and 2 - 3 cm on the stomach
* Usually combined with a **[antireflux procedure]()**  
  * Toupet Fundoplication
    * Improved long-term reflux control
    * Better visualization of the myotomy
    * More robust anti-reflux valve
  * Dor Fundoplication
    * Less disruption of hiatal anatomy
    * Fundal coverage of esophageal mucosa after myotomy

## Procedure

#### Positioning

* Lateral decubitus position (left side up)
* Bent at 7 - 8 intercostal space

#### Prepping

* Prep from top of shoulder to Iliac crest and anterior midline to spinous process (posterior)

#### Incision

* Incision 8 - 10 cm in 7th Intercostal Space
* Separation of Serratus Anterior to expose the Intercostal Muscles
* Intercostal Muscle removed from the superior aspect of the 8th Rib

#### Dissection

* Place *40F - 44F Bougie* to aid in identifying the Esophagus
* Division of the **Inferior Pulmonary Ligament** and retraction of the Left Lung cephalad
* Mediastinal Pleura incised from **Gastroesophageal Junction** to the **Inferior Pulmonary Vein** &#8594; exposes the Esophagus
* *Penrose drain* is used to encircle the exposed Esophagus if an **[antireflux procedure]()** is planned

> Care should be taken not to injure the **Anterior** or **Posterior Vagus Nerves** during this dissection

* The Esophagus is incised longitudinally from the **Inferior Pulmonary Vein** to the **Esophageal Hiatus** and extended 1 - 2 cm to the **Cardia**
  * The incision is made through the *Circular* and *Longitudinal* muscle layers
  * The Mucosa should be seen bulging underneath
* Blunt dissection with a *peanut dissector* should be used to raise the muscular wall off the Mucosa for approximately 50% of the circumference

> Care should be taken not to enter into the Mucosa

#### Inspection

* The *Bougie* is replaced by a *Nasogastric Tube*
* The chest cavity is filled with saline
* Air is gently injected into the *Nasogastric Tube* and the chest cavity is inspected for air bubbles
* If no bubbles are seen the *Penrose drain* is removed and the Esophagus is returned to its normal position
* If bubbles are seen then the Mucosa is closed with *absorbable sutures* reapproximating the muscle fibers
  * The opposite side is then used for the Myotomy

#### Completion

* A *Chest tube* is then placed into the pleural space and exited through a separate incision
  * The *Chest tube* is fixed to the chest wall using sutures (e.g. *2-0 silk suture*)
* An **[antireflux procedure]()** is usually added
  * Without fundoplication approximately 60% of patients report reflux symptoms
* The rib retractor is removed
* *0 Vicryl* suture is then placed around the 7th and 8th ribs
* The muscle layers are reapproximated using *2-0 absorbable sutures*
* The skin is closed using *staples* or *4-0 Monocryl*

## Postoperative Care

#### Immediate Postop

* The patient is admitted from PACU to the Floor
* The *Chest tube* is kept on continuous suction at 15 - 20 cm H2O
* The patient is kept NPO

#### POD 1

* **Contrast Esophagram** is obtained to rule out esophageal leak
* Diet is started if there is no leak
* The *Chest tube* is discontinued if there is no leak
* The patient is ambulatory

#### POD 2

* The patient is discharged home
