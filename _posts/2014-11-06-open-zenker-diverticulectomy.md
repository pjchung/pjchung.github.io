## Indications

* ***See [Zenker's Diverticula]({% post_url 2014-11-06-zenker-diverticula %})***

## Procedure

#### Positioning

* Usual approach is the left neck
* Patient supine with head slightly turned away from operative side

#### Prepping

* Betadine from Mastoid Process anteriorly to Spinous Process posteriorly
  * Angle of Mandible to Nipple line
  
#### Incision

* Incision at anterior border of left Sternocleidomastoid from Hyoid Bone to 1 cm above Clavicles

#### Dissection

* Dissection into Platysma and Deep Cervical Fascia
* Sternocleidomastoid and Carotid sheath retracted laterally
  * Exposes the **Retroesophageal space**
* Thyoid (gently) retracted medially
  * Sometimes the **Middle Thyroid Vein** must be ligated to retract the Thyroid

> Care should be made not to retract too forcefully to avoid damaging the **Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve**

* The **Omohyoid Muscle** can be retracted or divided and is moved superiorly

* The diverticula is grasped with Allis or Babcock clasp and dissected free from adjacent tissue
* 36F to 40F Bougie is placed into the Esophagus to help identify it
* Myotomy performed from **base of diverticula** through all transverse muscle fibers and unto the longitudinal muscle fibers and to a length of **8 - 10 cm**

#### Resection

* Diverticula &lt; 2 cm in diameter do not need to be resected
* Diverticula &ge; 2 cm in diameter typically are resected
* Resection of Zenkers by hand or stapler

#### Inspection

* Bougie switched for Nasogastric tube
* The chest cavity is filled with saline
* Air is gently injected into the *Nasogastric Tube* and the chest cavity is inspected for air bubbles (signifying a leak)
* A leak can be closed with fine interrupted sutures and reinforced with a muscle covering

#### Closure

* JP drain left and held with skin stay sutures
* Myotomy can be reapproximated
* Platysma is reapproximated using *4-0 absorbable sutures*
* Skin is closed


## Postoperative Care

#### Immediate Postop

* Transfered to floor
* NPO after procedure

#### POD 1

* Contrast esophageal study
* Diet started if no leak is found

#### POD 2

* DC Drains

#### POD 3 - 4

* Patient is disharged home
