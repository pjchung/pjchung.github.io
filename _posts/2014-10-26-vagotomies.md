## Truncal Vagotomy (A)
* Left Vagus Nerve &#8594; Anterior Trunk
* Right Vagus Nerve &#8594; Posterior Trunk (tends to be approximately 1 cm from posterior stomach wall)
* Divided at the level of the Distal Esophagus (approximately 4 cm from GEJ)
* Requires mobilization of approximately 5 - 6 cm of esophagus for adequate exposure to identify the nerves
* **Criminal Nerve of Grassi** is the first branch off the Posterior Trunk
  * Separation can be proximal to the Celiac Division of the Posterior Trunk
  * Failure to divide can result in recurrence (approximately 2/3 of ulcer recurrences are due to incomplete vagotomy)
* Requires a concommitant **Drainage Procedure**

## Selective Vagotomy (B)
* Spares Posterior branches that innervate
  * Pancreas
  * Small Intestines
* Spares Anterior branches that innervate
  * Liver
  * Gallbladder
* Decreases morbidity associated with Vagotomy such as Diarrhea and Dumping
* Used for **Refractory Duodenal Ulcers**
* Requres a concommitant **Drainage procedure**
  
## Highly Selective (Parietal Cell) Vagotomy (C)
* Preserves **Nerves of Latarjet** that innervate and provide motor function to the Pylorus
* Does **NOT** require a concommitant **Drainage procedure**
