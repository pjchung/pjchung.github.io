*Pearls from discussions with Dr. Boudourakis*

* Ways to decrease ICP
  * Raise head of bed
  * Mannitol/Hypertonic saline
  * Neurosedatives
  * Hypothermia
  * Ventriculostomy/Craniectomy

* **Mannitol/Hypertonic saline**
  * Should only be used on an as-need basis - this is to prevent further blunting of response that can occur with constant use (constant use leads to equilibration of Na in the brain)
  * > &le; 500cc **3% NS** (can be given via peripheral IV)
  * > &gt; 500cc **3% NS** (requires central line - Shock Trauma protocol)

* Neurosedatives
  1. **Propofol**
  1. **Benzodiazepines**
  1. **Barbituates**
  1. **Ketamine**
    * May be neuroprotective despite concerns of it raising ICP due to its effects on BP and HR (HTN and tachycardia)

* Hypothermia can be induced by
  * Cooling blankets
  * Cooling fluids prior to administration
    * e.g. 3% NS cooled in a slush of water/ice prior to administration
  * To avoid shivering
    * Increase sedation
    * Warm hands and feet with warm blankets
    * Paralyze patient (last resort)
