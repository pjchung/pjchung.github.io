## Overview

* Used to be a serious disease resulting in malnutrition, aspiration pneumonia, both, and death
* Described by **Zenker** and **von Ziemsen** in 1877
  * Zenker correlated anatomy to clinical presentation
  * Zenker and von Ziemsen also created the **Pulsion** and **Traction** classification for Esophageal diverticula

* First successful operative repair by **Wheeler** in Dublin in 1885

## Pathophysiology

* One of three types of esophageal diverticula
  * Zenker's (upper, *pulsion*)
  * Parabronchial (middle, *traction*)
  * Epiphrenic (lower, *pulsion*)
* Outpouching of **Pharyngeal mucosa** past the **Cricopharyngeal muscle** into **Killian's Triangle**
  * Only the mucosa herniates
  * False diverticula
* Thought to be an imbalance between pressure developed by the posterior Pharyngeal muscle contraction and weakness of mucosa in Killian's Triangle
  * Hypertensive **Upper Esophageal Sphincter (UES)**
  * Poorly coordinated relaxation of UES
  * More often than not is associated with other disorders of the Esophagus or GERD
* Most prevalent in 6th decade of life
* 3:1 male to female ratio

## Diagnosis

* **Symptoms**
  * Dysphagia (most common)
  * History of pneumonia
  * "Wet voice" &#8594; sounds as if person were talking while gargling a small quantity of fluid
* **Contrast Swallow Study**
* **Video Esophagography** &#8594; superior to Contrast Swallow Study
* **EGD** &#8594; not necessary if Zenker's is seen on Swallow Studies

## Operative Indications

* Patients can hold off on surgical therapy as long as they can tolerate symptoms
* Respiratory symptoms
  * Nighttime chocking episodes
  * History of pneumonia
* Dysphagia with weight loss

## Surgical Principles

* Three types of procedures can be performed
  1. **[Diverticulectomy with Primary Repair and Cricopharyngeal Myotomy]({% post_url 2014-11-06-open-zenker-diverticulectomy %})**
  1. Diverticular Suspension to the Prevertebral Fascia and Cricopharyngeal Myotomy
  1. Transoral Endoscopic Stapled Diverticulectomy
* The diverticula tends to present on the left
