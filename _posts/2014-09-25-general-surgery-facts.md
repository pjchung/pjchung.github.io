## Diagnostic Modalities

* Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)
  * First white line &#8594; **Mucosa**
  * First black line &#8594; **Muscularis Mucosae**
  * Second white line &#8594; **Submucosa**
  * Second black line &#8594; **Muscularis Propria (both inner circular and outer linear layers)**
  * Third white line &#8594; **Serosa**

## Esophagus

* CT is not sufficient to detect luminal Esophageal Tumors
* Barretts esophagus has a 0.5-1.0% progression to Esophageal Cancer per year

## Stomach

* Marginal ulcers occur among only 10% or fewer of patients who undergo gastric bypass and respond to H2-receptor antagonists
* Marginal ulcers form because Jejunal mucosa is not ready to handle acidic fluid from stomach (similar to what happens in a **Meckel's Diverticulum**)
* The most serious complication after gastric bypass for obesity is anastomotic dehiscence
* Vitamin B12 deficiency can occur after gastric bypass owing to decreased acid digestion of vitamin B12 in food
* Cholelithiasis occurs among approximately one third of morbidly obese patients, and gallstone formation is accelerated in the early postoperative period by the effects of rapid weight loss
* Vagal innervation induces relaxation of fundic tone
* Without the vagus, fundic tone increases (e.g. after Vagotomy)
* Gastrin is a potent stimulant of blood flow, in proportion to its ability to increase acid secretion
* Vagal nerve stimulation has the net effect of increasing mucosal and total gastric blood flow; sympathetic nerve stimulation is accompanied by opposite effects
* With ingestion of a meal, increasing gastric volumes are accommodated with little increase in intragastric pressure by relaxation of the proximal stomach
* Receptive relaxation, is mediated by a reflex carried by the vagal nerve
* Proximal stomach is the predominant determinant of the rate of gastric emptying of liquids as a result of the gastroduodenal pressure gradient generated by proximal gastric contractions
* After vagotomy, an increased gastroduodenal pressure gradient occurs and correlates with **accelerated liquid emptying**
* Emptying of solids usually is not greatly altered by proximal gastric vagotomy
* One prominent hypothesis has been that H pylori infection of the antrum selectively blocks the inhibitory reflex pathways from the antrum to the gastrin-producing cells and the parietal cells of the proximal stomach
* Many tests are available to the practicing clinician for the diagnosis of H pylori, including endoscopic biopsy, CLO tests, breath tests, and serum antibodies, but none is really a gold standard, particularly in young patients
* **Dieulafoy Vascular Malformation** is an unusual cause of recurrent hematemesis in which bleeding originates from an unusually large (1 to 3 mm in diameter) artery running through the gastric submucosa for variable distances
* **Dieulafoy Vascular Malformations** characteristically are located within 6 cm of the esophagogastric junction along the lesser curvature
* Management of **Dieulafoy Vascular Malformations** consists of excision of the gastric wall bearing the lesion by means of wedge resection of the proximal lesser curvature
* Patients with **Roux-en-Y with Pouch** have a better quality of life and better nutritional measures than those with a **Roux-en-Y Esophagojejunostomy**

## Biliary Disease

* The Gallbladder does **NOT** have a submucosa
* Ampullary Neoplasms - need to decide between **Ampullectomy** vs **Pancreaticoduodenectomy**
* Benign Ampullary Neoplasms
  * Villous Adenoma (most common)
  * Carcinoids
  * Lipomas
  * Adenomatous Polyps
* Malignant Ampullary Neoplasms
* Radical Pancreaticoduodenectomy for Malignant lesions or multiple adenomas
* **Sclerosing Cholangitis** typically does **NOT** involve the extrahepatic biliary tree
* Bile Cholesterol Saturation Index is determined by the relative concentrations of Cholesterol, Lecithin, Bile Salts
* **Chronic Acalculous Cholecystitis** is diagnosed with HIDA scan showing an ejection fraction &lt; 35%
* Treatment of **Emphysematous Cholecystitis** requires treating *E. coli*, *Klebsiella*, *Enterococcus*, and *Clostridia spp.*
* *Clonorchis sinensis* = Human Liver Fluke - responsible for **Oriental Cholangiohepatitis**
* Cholesterol crystals tend to precipitate around *nucleating agents* such as Biliary Mucin Glycoproteins or Epithelium

## Large Bowel

* 5-FU is a radiosensitizer
* Vascular ectasia occurs most commonly in cecum or ascending colon (right colon)
* Pyoderma Gangrenosum is associated with Ulcerative Colitis
* Krukenberg tumor = metastatic adenocarcinoma (stomach > colon > appendix > breast) to the ovaries (B/L in 80%)
* 5-FU is used in unresectable hepatic metastases from colon cancer confined to the liver
* 1% of appendectomy specimens contain neoplasms (2/3 are carcinoids)
* Ulcerative Panophthalmitis (in Ulcerative Colitis patients) does not respond to steroid/immunosuppresive agents
* Tumors &gt; 2 cm at the base of the appendix warrant Right Hemicolectomy
* Adenomas (polyps) of the colon in which disease is above the Mucularis Mucosae is carcinoma in situ
* Submucosal inflammation/thickening/fibrosis are more common with Crohn\'s Disease than Ulcerative Colitis
* CEA is elevated in 90% of patients with disseminated colorectal cancer and 20% of patients with localized colorectal cancer
* Polyps &lt; 1 cm contain carcinoma in 1 - 2% of cases
* Polyps &gt; 2 cm contain carcinoma in 40% of cases
* Alvimopam is an opioid antagonist that is peripherally acting and does not cross the BBB and decreases postop ileus time (FDA approved for small and large bowel resections with primary anastomosis)
* FAP can be associated with Desmoid Tumors
* FAP is a result of mutation of the APC gene in chromosome 5q
* Most common postop complication of Restorative Proctocolectomy in Ulcerative Colitis is SBO

## Rectum

* Rectal Carcinoid arises in submucosa, is small and well encapsulated
* On EUS internal anal sphincter appears as a hypoechoic horseshoe structure while the external anal sphincter appears as a hyperechoic structure
