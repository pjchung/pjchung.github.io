## Overview

* First described by **Norman Barrett** in 1950
  * Findings of a distal Esophagus ulcer associated with Esophagitis and columnar epithelium
* Defined today as a pathologic replacement of esophagus' normal stratified squamous epithelium with intestinal-like columnar epithelium
* Induced by chronic esophageal injury and inflammation caused by **[GERD]({% post_url 2014-10-26-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease %})**
  * Exposure to both acid and alkali (unconjugated bile acids) substances
  * Arguably the presence of Barrett's Esophagus is a marker for severe GERD that requires treatment
* Found in approximately 10 - 15% of patients undergoing upper endoscopy
* Prevalence rate in United States approximately 5.6%
* Is the most identifiable risk factor for **[Esophageal Adenocarcinoma]()**
  * Increases risk of developing Esophageal Adenocarcinoma by 30 - 125 times
  * Annual transformation rate of approximately 0.5%
  * However the poor survival rates for Esophageal Adenocarcinoma (&lt; 17% 5 year survival) demand diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment
* Transformation
  * Non-dysplastic columnar epithelium &#8594; Low-Grade Dysplasia (LGD) &#8594; High-Grade Dysplasia (HGD) &#8594; Invasive Carcinoma
  * Poor inter-observer agreement for LGD (&lt; 50%)
  * Medium-high inter-observer agreement for HGD (85%)
  * Variability in inter-observer agreement rates likely the cause for wide range of estimates for dysplasia to cancer transformation rates (0.9 - 13.5%)
* HGD is the most reliable predictor for development of invasive malignancy
  * Annual transformation rate of 6%

## Diagnosis

* Endoscopy
  * Visualization of "salmon" colored "tongues" of epithelium
  * Histologic confirmation
    * Four quadrant biopies of intervals of every other centimeter of suspected BE and any mucosal irregularities (e.g. nodules or ulcers)
    * Columnar intestinal epithelium
    * Presence of **Goblet Cells**

  <tr>

    <td>High-grade Dysplasia</td>
    <td>Abnormal columnar epithelium with loss of cell polarity, atypical mitotic activity, loss of goblet cells, and distortion of crypt architecture.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Intramucosal Adenocarcinoma</td>
    <td>Dysplasia penetrating basement membrane and infiltrates into lamina propria but not submucosa (T1a). Lesions penetrating past lamina propria or muscularis mucosa designated as T1b invasive EAC.</td>

## Treatment

* Principle is to first control GERD effectively

#### Surveillance

* Surveillance recommended in 3 - 5 year intervals for **BE without dysplasia**
* Surveillance recommended every 6 - 12 months for **LGD**
* Surveillance recommended every 3 months for **HGD who have not undergone ablative therapies** (*see Endoscopic Therapy*)
* Four-quadrant biopsies taken
  * 2 cm intervals for patients without Dysplasia
  * 1 cm intervals for patients with Dysplasia
  * Reviewed by at least 2 Pathologists

#### Medical Therapy

* **Proton-pump Inhibitors (PPI)** are First Line therapy
  * Long-term use of PPIs is called into question due to the growing evidence of risks associated with long-term use
  * Associated with **Osteoporosis-related Fractures**
  * Associated with increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (*Salmonella*, *Campylobacter*, and *Clostridium difficile*)
  * ***C. difficile*** has the highest association with PPI use
* **Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID)**
  * Shown to decrease the proliferation of BE cells
  * Shown to decrease the neoplastic progression of BE to Esophageal Adenocarcinoma
  * Not clear whether benefits outweigh risks at this time
  * Not recommended to initiate NSAIDs for chemoprevention

#### Endoscopic Therapy

* **Endoscopic therapies for underlying GERD**
  * **Stretta System**
    * Induction of thermal injury to the Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES)
    * Results in scarring and collagen deposition at the GEJ
    * Or causes ablation of Vagal afferent fibers
  * **EsophyX**
    * **Transoral Incisionless Fundoplication (TIF)**
  * However none of these methods have demonstrated long-term improvements in the pH levels or cessation of antireflux medications
* **Endoscopic Ablation Therapies**
  * Goal is to eradicate BE and repopulate with normal squamous cells
  * Ablation should extend through **muscularis mucosa** but not through **submucosa** &#8594; increased risk of stricture
  * **Argon Beam Plasma Coagulation (ABPC)**
    * Monopolar electrocautery to tissue via flow of ionized argon gas plasma
    * Requires multiple treatment sessions
    * Depth of ablation not well controlled
  * **Multipolar Electrocoagulation (MPEC)**
    * Passing current between electrodes which are in direct contact with tissue
    * Requires multiple treatment sessions
    * Depth of ablation not well controlled
  * **Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)**
    * Bipolar energy via direct contact with the esophageal mucosa in a controlled duration and intensity
      * Reliable tissue penetration without submucosal injury
    * Initial circumferential therapy followed by focused therapy
    * **HALO 360 System**
      * Can achieve reversion in up to 97% of patients with **Non-Dysplastic BE**
      * Can achieve reversion in up to 90% of patients with **LGD**
    * Becoming the ablation treatment of choice
    * No data to support that RFA is more effective at reducing cancer risk or more cost-effective than surveillance
  * **Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)**
    * Systemic administration of a photosensitizer (e.g. ***porfimer sodium***) that accumulates in **HGD** and **neoplastic cells**
    * Endoscopic delivery of a low-energy, nonthermal laser beam activates the photosensitizer
    * Enables oxygen radical formation and cell destruction
    * Drawbacks include ***skin photosensitivity***, symptomatic strictures, and buried BE
  * **Cryotherapy Ablation**
    * Low-pressure liquid nitrogen and carbon dioxide spray
    * Rapid freeze-thaw cycle leading to destruction of BE and regeneration of squamous epithelium
    * Requires repeat sessions every 4 - 6 weeks until BE eradicated
    * Decompression of stomach prior to procedure required due to carbon dioxide gas
    * Non-cardiac chest pain is a side effect
* Ablative therapies are limited in that they cannot assess depth of **HGD** nor detect unsuspected foci of Esophageal Adenocarcinoma
* **Endoscopic Mucosal Resection**
  * Requires using **Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)** to evaluate depth of invasion and periesophageal lymphadenopaty
    * Not reliable for detecting **submucosal invasion** (sensitivity of 48%)
  * Curative treatment for **HGD** or **T1a Esophageal Adenocarcinoma**
    * &lt; 2 cm in size 
    * Non-ulcerated lesions
    * No submucosal involvement
    * No Lymph Node involvement
    * No systemic disease
  * Advantage over Ablative Therapies is the ability to obtain a large specimen &#8594; therapeutic and diagnostic
  * Bleeding is the most commonly reported morbidity
    * Treated endoscopically with injections
  * Stenosis can occur months after initial therapy
  * Perforation also reported (0.06 - 5%)
* **Endoscopic Submucosal Resection**
  * Developed in Japan to treat **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** and considered one of the gold standard therapies
    * Therefore may not be applicable to **EAC** &#8594; SCC tends to occur in Mid-Esophagus which is more tubular and amenable to dissection
  * Not widely available in the United States
  * Requires post-procedure hospitalization
    * Up to 10% perforation risk
    * Bleeding and stricture also have been reported
    * Is a time-consuming and technically challenging procedure with a steep learning curve

#### Surgical Therapy

* **[Antireflux Procedures]()**
  * Long-term results equal or superior to medical therapy
  * Improved GERD-specific quality of life compared to medical therapy
  * Improvements in symptoms of heartburn, reflux, bloating
  * Promotes regression of BE
  * Unclear whether Antireflux Procedures prevent Esophageal Adenocarcinoma
* **Esophagectomy**
  * The gold standard in treatment for **HGD**
  * Cures and serves as a prophylaxis against Esophageal Adenocarcinoma in patients with **HGD**
  * Overall perioperative mortality of 0.94%
  * Initial and prolonged adjustment period
  * However quality-of-life score similar to national norm by 5 years
