## Overview

* First described by **Norman Barrett** in 1950
  * Findings of a distal Esophagus ulcer associated with Esophagitis and columnar epithelium
* Defined today as a pathologic replacement of esophagus' normal stratified squamous epithelium with intestinal-like columnar epithelium
* Induced by chronic esophageal injury and inflammation caused by **[GERD]({% post_url 2014-10-26-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease %})**
  * Exposure to both acid and alkali (unconjugated bile acids) substances
  * Arguably the presence of Barrett's Esophagus is a marker for severe GERD that requires treatment
* Is the most identifiable risk factor for **[Esophageal Adenocarcinoma]()**
  * Annual transformation rate of approximately 0.5%
  * However the poor survival rates for Esophageal Adenocarcinoma (&lt; 17% 5 year survival) demand diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment
* Transformation
  * Non-dysplastic columnar epithelium &#8594; Low-Grade Dysplasia (LGD) &#8594; High-Grade Dysplasia (HGD) &#8594; Invasive Carcinoma
  * Poor inter-observer agreement for LGD (&lt; 50%)
  * Medium-high inter-observer agreement for HGD (85%)
  * Variability in inter-observer agreement rates likely the cause for wide range of estimates for dysplasia to cancer transformation rates (0.9 - 13.5%)
* HGD is the most reliable predictor for development of invasive malignancy
  * Annual transformation rate of 6%

## Diagnosis

* Endoscopy
  * Visualization of "salmon" colored epithelium
  * Histologic confirmation
    * Columnar intestinal epithelium
    * Presence of **Goblet Cells**

#### Prague C and M Criteria

* **C** = Circumferential extent
* **M** = Maximal extent

## Treatment

* Principle is to first control GERD effectively

#### Surveillance

* Surveillance recommended every 6 to 12 months for LGD
* Surveillance recommended every 3 months for HGD who have not undergone ablative therapies (*see Endoscopic Therapy*)
* Four-quadrant biopsies taken
  * 2 cm intervals for patients without Dysplasia
  * 1 cm intervals for patients with Dysplasia
  * Reviewed by at least 2 Pathologists

#### Medical Therapy

* **Proton-pump Inhibitors (PPI)** are First Line therapy
  * Long-term use of PPIs is called into question due to the growing evidence of risks associated with long-term use
  * Associated with **Osteoporosis-related Fractures**
  * Associated with increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (*Salmonella*, *Campylobacter*, and *Clostridium difficile*)
  * *C. difficile* has the highest association with PPI use
* **Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID)**
  * Shown to decrease the proliferation of BE cells
  * Shown to decrease the neoplastic progression of BE to Esophageal Adenocarcinoma
  * Not clear whether benefits outweigh risks at this time
  * Not recommended to initiate NSAIDs for chemoprevention

#### Endoscopic Therapy

* Endoscopic therapies for GERD exist
  * **Stretta System**
    * Induction of thermal injury to the Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES)
    * Results in scarring and collagen deposition at the GEJ
    * Or causes ablation of Vagal afferent fibers
  * **EsophyX**
    * *Transoral Incisionless Fundoplication (TIF)*
  * However none of these methods have demonstrated long-term improvements in the pH levels or cessation of antireflux medications
* **Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)**
  * **HALO 360 System**
    * Can achieve reversion in up to 97% of patients with **Non-Dysplastic BE**
    * Can achieve reversion in up to 90% of patients with **LGD**
  * No data to support that RFA is more effective at reducing cancer risk or more cost-effective than surveillance
* **Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)**
  * Systemic administration of a photosensitizer (e.g. *porfimer sodium*) that accumulates in **HGD** and **neoplastic cells**
  * Endoscopic delivery of a low-energy, nonthermal laser beam activates the photosensitizer
  * Enables oxygen radical formation and cell destruction
* Ablative therapies are limited in that they cannot assess depth of **HGD** nor detect unsuspected foci of Esophageal Adenocarcinoma
* **Endoscopic Mucosal Resection**
  * Curative treatment for **HGD** or **T1a Esophageal Adenocarcinoma &lt; 2 cm in size without Lymph Node involvement or systemic disease**
  * Advantage over Ablative Therapies is the ability to obtain a large specimen &#8594; therapeutic and diagnostic

#### Surgical Therapy

* **[Antireflux Procedures]()**
  * Long-term results equal or superior to medical therapy
  * Improved GERD-specific quality of life compared to medical therapy
  * Improvements in symptoms of heartburn, reflux, bloating
  * Promotes regression of BE
  * Unclear whether Antireflux Procedures prevent Esophageal Adenocarcinoma
* **Esophagectomy**
  * The gold standard in treatment for **HGD**
  * Cures and serves as a prophylaxis against Esophageal Adenocarcinoma in patients with **HGD BE**
  * Overall perioperative mortality of 0.94%
  * Initial and prolonged adjustment period
  * However quality-of-life score similar to national norm by 5 years
