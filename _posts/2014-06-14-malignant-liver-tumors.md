## Goals
* Determine resectability of the tumor
  * Resectable
    * Small
    * Localized
    * Technically feasible
    * Sufficient liver remnant to support life
  * Unresectable
    * Small
      * Liver transplantation
      * Thermal ablation
    * Large/Multiple/Disseminated
      * Transcatheter Embolization (TACE)
      * Systemic therapies
      
## Primary Hepatic Malignancies

### Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
* Most common *solid* tumor worldwide
  * Incidence of 1,000,000 cases/year worldwide
  * Incidence of 25,000 cases/year in US
* Pathophysiology
  * Liver parenchymal injury
    * Chronic hepatitis B/C viral infection
  * Poor survival
    * \<5%
    * Associated cirrhosis precludes resection
    
#### Surgical Resection
* Liver-localized disease and good hepatic reserve
* Tend to be **Child A cirrhosis**
* Prognosis
  * Western series 5-year survival rates range from 21 - 49%
  * Eastern series 5-year survival rates range from 30 - 50%
    * Mortality rates range from 1.6 - 5.3%
    * Lower survival linked to higher rates of cirrhosis and hepatitis B infection

#### Liver Transplantation
* Offered to cirrhotic patients without cardiopulmonary comorbid conditions and limited local disease
* **Milan Criteria**
  * 1 tumor \< 5 cm in size
  * &le; 3 tumors each \< 3 cm in size
* 5-year survival ranges from 60 - 80%

#### Thermal Ablation
* Radiofrequency or Microwave ablation
* Effectiveness directly related to size of tumor and ease of access
* Routes
  * Open surgery
  * Laparoscopy
  * Percutaneous access
* Decreased effectiveness when near major blood vessels
  * Vessels can act as \"heat sinks\"
* Equal survival for resection vs radiofrequency ablation in small HCC
* Morbidity rate \< 10%
* Mortality rate \< 0.5%

#### Embolization
* For unresectable lesions
* Modalities
  * Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE)
  * Transarterial Embolization (TAE)
  * Radioembolization
* Contraindications
  * Thrombosis of portal vein
  * Risk of severe hepatic insufficiency after embolization procedure
* Complications
  * **Postembolization syndrome**
    * Fevers
    * Abdominal pain
  * Gallbladder infarction
  * Pancreatitis
  * Hepatic insufficiency
  * Sepsis
* Response rates can reach 80%
* TAE and TACE require interval treatment every 3 - 6 months


### Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma
* Very different from HCC
* Occurs in patients without parenchymal injury or cirrhosis
* Median age of 27 years
* **Primary neuroendocrine tumor of the liver**
  * Secrete characteristic hormones/proteins
    * Neurotensin
    * Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-binding protein
  * Well circumscribed
  * Separate from adjacent blood vessels
  * Slow growing
* 5-year survival rates range from 30 - 50%
* Nodal metastases in 15 - 30% of cases
  * Inspection of lymph nodes
    * Porta hepatis
    * Celiac region
    * Peripancreatic region
    

### Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma (ICC)
* Epidemiology
  * AKA **\"Peripheral Cholangiocarcinoma\"**
  * Associated with viral hepatitis and cirrhosis
  * More common in Southeast Asia
  * Incidence of 5,000 cases/year in US
* Surgical resection only potentially curative option
* Diagnostic laparoscopy due to high incidence of peritoneal metastases
* Nodal metastases in 1/3 of cases
  * Sampling and formal dissection of positive nodes
* Most patients are not candidates for resection due to metastases
  * Peritoneal
  * Lung
  * Bone
* 5-year survival rates for R0 resection ranges from 44 - 63%
* Mortality rate ranges from 2 - 7%

## Preoperative Assessment

#### Overview
* Make the diagnosis of primary liver malignancy
  * Tumor staging
* Assess comorbid conditions
  * Chronic renal failure
  * Pulmonary disease
  * Heart disease
  * Diabetes
* Obtain baseline liver function
* Size of future liver remnant (FLR)

#### Bloodwork
* CBC
* Coagulation profile (PT/INR/PTT)
* CMP
* Hepatitis panel
* Tumor markers
  * Alpha-fetoprotean (AFP)
  * Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
  * Cancer angtigen 19-9 (CA 19-9)
  
#### Imaging
* Triple-phase CT abdomen/pelvis
  * Increase uptake in arterial phase (hypervascular tumors)
    * HCC
    * Metastatic neuroendocrine tumors
  * Increase uptake in portal venous phase
    * ICC
    * Metastatic colorectal cancer
* Abdominal MRI
* Diagnosis of HCC in equivocal cases
  * Lesions \> 2 cm that appear hypervascular on 2 separate imaging modalities (CT and MRI)
  * Focal hypervascular lesion \> 2 cm and serum AFP > 400 ng/mL
* Metastatic workup
  * CT Chest with IV contrast
  * Bone scan (patients with HCC)

#### Assessing Liver Function

**Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CPT) Score**

| Measure | 1 Point | 2 Points | 3 Points |
|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| Total bilirubin (mg/dL) | \< 2 | 2 - 3 | \> 3 |
| Serum albumin (g/L) | \> 35 | 28 - 35 | \< 28 |
| PT/INR | \< 1.7 | 1.71 - 2.30 | \> 2.3 |
| Ascites | None | Mild | Moderate to Severe |
| Hepatic encephalopathy | None | Grade I - II (suppressed with medication) | Grades III - IV (refractory) |

* **Class A** = 5 - 6 points
  * Considered candidates for resection
* **Class B** = 7 - 9 points
  * Operative mortality of 30%
* **Class C** = 10 - 15 points
  * Operative mortality of 80%
  
#### Miscellaneous Risk Factors
* Platelet count \< 100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>
* Radiologic indicators of cirrhosis/portal hypertension
  * Contour of liver
  * Splenomegaly
* Periportal and abdominal wall collateral vessels
* Esophageal varices

#### Future Liver Remnant
* Healthy non-cirrhotic liver
  * FLR of 20% is adequate
* Chronic liver disease
  * FLR of 40% correlates with acceptable risk
* Calculation
  * **3D CT Volumetry**
    * FLR is the total liver volume calculated slice by slice minus planned resection volume
  * **Total Liver Volume (TLV)** = -794.41 + 1267.28 x body surface area (m<sup>2</sup>)
* **Standardized FLR**
  * Ratio of 3D CT Volumetry to TLV
  * Standardized FLR volume \< 300 mL/m<sup>2</sup> correlates to death and liver failure
* **Portal Vein Embolization (PVE)**
  * Induce contralateral liver growth before resection
  * Percutaneous access of ipsilateral portal vein
  * Particle embolization
    * Microparticles and microcoils
  * Hypoxia-induced growth factors and shunted portal venous flow induces growth to contralateral lobe
  * In-vivo assessment of regenerative capacity
  * Benefits
    * Decreases hepatic insufficiency
    * Decreases perioperative complications
    * Decreases post-operative mortality
  * Can be used after TACE for HCC
    * Aid in resection
    * Decrease spillage
