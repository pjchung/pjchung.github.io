## Important Figures
* **J. Marion Sims** (late 1800s)
  * Criticized high mortality associated with nonoperative approach to abdominal gunshot wounds
  * Began era of mandatory exploration of all injuries
* **G. W. Shaftman** (1960s)
  * Introducted concept of \"selective conservatism\"
  * Observed that most penetrating abdominal trauma did not result in injuries requiring operative repair
  
  
## Anatomic Definitions

#### Anterior Abdomen
* Superior border: transverse line through inferior costal margins
* Inferior border: groin creases
* Lateral borders: anterior axillary line
* Injury Risks
  * Highest rate of intraperitoneal injury
  * Least amenable to nonoperative approach

#### Flank
* Superior border: inferior costal margin
* Inferior border: anterior superior iliac spines (ASIS)
* Anterior border: anterior axillary lines
* Posterior border: posterior axillary lines
* Injury Risks
  * Lower incidence of injury requiring operative management (vs anterior abdominal wounds)
  * Usually requires CT with contrast to identify injuries

#### Back
* Superior border: transverse line through inferior scapular tips
* Inferior border: transverse line through posterior superior iliac spines
* Lateral borders: posterior axillary lines
* Injury Risks
  * Lower incidence of injury requiring operative management (vs anterior abdominal wounds)
  * Usually requires CT with contrast to identify injuries

#### Thoracoabdomen
* Superior border:
  * Men: transverse line through nipples
  * Women: inframammary fold
* Inferior border: transverse line across inferior costal margins
* Lateral borders: anterior axillary lines
* Injury Risks
  * Must determine whether hemorrhage is abdominal vs thoracic vs both
  * Diaphragm is vulnerable to injury
  * 90% of left-sided diaphgram injuries associated with intraabdominal injuries


## Risk Stratification
* High Risk
  * Abdominal GSWs
    * 90% rate of abdominal injuries requiring operative intervention
    * Take to the OR
* Low Risk
  * Flank/Back GSWs
    * 10 - 15% abdominal injury rate
  * Isolated RUQ GSWs
  * Morbidly Obese
* Shotgun Wounds
  * Type I: > 25 cm scatter
    * 1/3 patients do not need operative intervention
  * Type II: 10 - 25 cm scatter
  * Type III: < 10 cm scatter
* Anterior Abdominal Stab Wounds (AAWS)
  * 50 - 75% enter peritoneal cavity
  * 50 - 75% of SWs entering peritoneal cavity require operative repair
  * Overall only 20% of AASWs require operative intervention (higher in anterior abdominal SWs vs back/flank SWs)
