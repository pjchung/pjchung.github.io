#### Hypothenar Hammer Syndrome
* Repeated trauma to palm of hands
* Fibromuscular dysplasia in **Ulnar Artery** leading to ***aneurysm formation***
* Aneurysm can cause thrombus formation and embolization
* Resection of aneurysmal portion of vessel with reconstruction using vein interposition graft

#### Dysphagia Lusoria
* Difficulty in swallowing due to compression of the esophagus by an **Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery**
* Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery arises **distal** to the Left Subclavian Artery and transverses the Mediastinum posterior to the Esophagus and Trachea
* Can result in the formation of an aortic diverticulum ***Kommerell Diverticulum***
* **Bovine Arch** is where the **Left Common Carotid Artery** and the **Innominate Artery** share a common origin off the aortic arch

#### Splenic Artery Aneurysm
* Four times more common in women
* Most common visceral artery aneurysm
* Mortality rate of rupture is 70%
* **Double Rupture Phenomenon** is where the initial bleed is initially contained in the **Lesser Sac** followed by free rupture into the peritoneum causing hemodynamic compromise
* Repair for
  * Women of child-bearing age
  * SAAs &ge; 3 cm
* Proximal SAAs
  * **Exclusion** with proximal and distal ligation of Splenic Artery
* Middle SAAs
  * **Excision** of the aneurysm
* Distal SAAs
  * **Splenectomy**
  * Aneurysm exclusion and vascular reconstruction

#### Femoral Pseudoaneurysm
* Symptoms
  * Pain
  * Pulsatile mass
  * Compression of adjacent structures
* Diagnosed via **Duplex Ultrasonography**
* &lt; 2 cm in diameter
  * Higher likelihood of spontaneous thrombosis
  * Ammenable to **US-guided Compression** therapy
* &ge; 2 cm in diameter
  * **US-guided Thrombin Injection** therapy
  
#### HIV-related Artery Aneurysms
* Multiple aneurysms at unusual sites
* **Common Carotid Artery** > **Superficial Femoral Artery** > **Abdominal Aorta**
* Look like **pseudoaneurysms**
* Seronegative or Seropositive without AIDS (good prognosis)
  * Reconstruction using autogenous tissue (eg Saphenous Vein)
* Seropositive with AIDS (poor prognosis)
  * Endovascular intervention
  * Observation
